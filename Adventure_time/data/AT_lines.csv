Bufo,  Direct your attention to the scale-model orb.,Wizard
Finn,  Huh? [Looks at viewing globe] Is that an asteroid heading for this very temple?,Wizard
Bufo,"  Yes. It's been heading for this temple for 847 years. Only the magic of the ultimate wizards keeps it from getting any closer. Quickly, add your power to that of the orb.",Wizard
Finn,"  Oh, okay. [Does it; the force of the blast pushes Finn backwards.] Whoa! I got it! Now what?",Wizard
Bufo,  Now I release the elder Jeremy from his pledge. Razzamafoo!,Wizard

Finn,"  Whoo-hoo! Nice job! Thanks to us, the village is saved. And we reclaimed a few of your twilight years!",Wizard
Bufo,  Don't forget to thank me. For this was my plan for all of these 847 years.,Wizard
Finn,  No way! Your plan was to dupe a succession of rubes into keeping the asteroid at bay!,Wizard
Bufo,  [Guilty] Perhaps you're right. No more giving out free powers. I hereby renounce all magic. [Bufo and the host cry. The host sits on the ground.] My life is oveeeeeer!,Wizard

Finn,"  Yeah. Hey, look. [Finn grabs a bottle shaped like a boomerang.] This one looks stupid. Let's see how it flies! [Finn throws the bottle. It misses the wall and flies away.] Aw, lame.

Finn,  But we're the ones who threw the bottle!,The Duke
Jake,"  Dude, look. The Duke of Nuts is bad guys.",The Duke
Finn,  How do you know that?,The Duke

Finn,  Maybe you're right.,The Duke
Jake,  Maybe I am!,The Duke
Finn,"  Alright, just this once, we'll be vigilantes!",The Duke

Jake,"  [Jake starts eating the nuts from the bowl. He then stops in realization.] Oh... should've asked if these were, like, her eggs or something.",The Duke
Duchess of Nuts,  I know of my husband's crime against the princess. A crime that you personally witnessed! And why would you lie? Huh?,The Duke
Finn,"  Yeah, why?",The Duke
Duchess of Nuts," Oh but he was once such a wonderful man! He'd pet dogs, kissed babies; we'd lie together underneath the cashew bush. He even taught under-privileged nuts how to dance.

Action," [Finn runs out, grabbing Jake.]",The Duke
Jake,  Woah!,The Duke
Action, [Scene changes to outside the Duke of Nuts' Castle. Finn closes the door behind him.],The Duke
Finn,"  I don't get it, Jake. How can the dude be evil if he pets puppies, kisses babies, and lies with his wife?",The Duke

Jake,  That's the Duke of Nuts.,The Duke
Marquis of Nuts,"  But I vowed to kill whoever did this to you. They can't take you away, Dad! [cries]",The Duke
Duke of Nuts,  Who's the toughest little nut? That's you. [Marquis of Nuts continues to cry into the Duke of Nuts' shoulder.] [He puts one finger up to Finn and Jake.] One second.,The Duke
Action, [Finn uses his hands to ask if they should walk away. The Duke of Nuts thumbs them up. Finn and Jake walk away.],The Duke
Finn,"  Man, I don't know, Jake. Why would Princess Bubblegum hate him if he's such a nice guy?",The Duke
Jake,"  Just because he's a good father, doesn't necessarily mean he isn't a villain.",The Duke
Finn,  That doesn't look like a villain.,The Duke
Action, [Camera shows the Duke of Nuts putting his cape down for geese to walk across so they don't get wet.],The Duke
Jake,  I can probably think of a reason why that's villainous if you gave me enough time. Maybe.,The Duke
Finn,"  Ugh! Maybe we should just confess. But then, Princess Bubblegum will hate us forever.",The Duke
Jake,"  Hey man, it's not that bad being hated.",The Duke
Action, [A letter flies near Jake's foot.],The Duke
Squirrel,"  C'mon man, pick it up!",The Duke
Action," [Finn and Jake walk by it, unnoticed.]",The Duke
Squirrel,  You son of a bleeblop!,The Duke
Duke of Nuts,"  Oh! Sorry to make you wait. I made these daisy crowns for you guys as a- as a token of gratitude for waiting. [Finn and Jake put the crowns on.] Oh...sorry I....I have to sit down for a second. I know this is an odd question, but you wouldn't happen to have any pudding on you, would you?",The Duke
Finn,"  Actually yeah, I think I have one in my pack.",The Duke
Duke of Nuts,"  Oh, thank goodness.",The Duke
Finn,  I think I have a spoon in here too- wha-?,The Duke

Jake,  What happened to the cup?,The Duke
Action, [The Duke takes it out of his mouth and puts it in Jake's hand.],The Duke
Duke of Nuts,"  Oh, I'm so embarrassed! Now you know my shame. I can't stop eating pudding.",The Duke
Finn,  What?!,The Duke
Duke of Nuts,"  I don't tell people because I hate making them worry, but yes, I have a rare condition. A pudding deficiency. And I always end up eating all of the royal pudding supply whenever I go to the castle.",The Duke
Finn,  So that's why Princess Bubblegum hates you!,The Duke
Duke of Nuts,"  Yes, but I didn't turn Princess Bubblegum green and bald! I would never do such a thing!",The Duke
Finn,"  Gah! Of course you wouldn't! You're too nice a guy. I'm the one who threw that bottle. I was gonna tell her, but then-- she started talking all crazy-- she said she'd never forgive me and I-- I didn't know!",The Duke
Duke of Nuts,"  Hey, it's okay. People make mistakes. It's all part of growing up and you never truly stop growing.",The Duke
Finn,  Now you're making me feel even worse by being so nice about it.,The Duke
Duke of Nuts,  Maybe I should just confess the crime and end all of this.,The Duke
Finn,  Wait...I think I might have an idea that will save everyone's reputations.,The Duke
Action, [Scene changes to later that day. Peppermint Butler is driving Princess Bubblegum around in a mobile bath tub filled with healing milk. Finn jumps out of the forest and stops them.],The Duke
Finn,  Halt!,The Duke
Princess Bubblegum,  Finn! Did you find the duke yet?,The Duke
Finn,"  Not yet, but you are in grave danger, Princess. There is an assassin in these very woods, dead set on stopping you from reaching the Grand Meeting. In fact, what's that rustling in the bush??",The Duke
Jake,"  [behind bush while shaking the bush] Rustle. Rustle, rustle. [Jake jumps out suddenly.] I'm an ambush! Halt!",The Duke
Finn,  What's going on?!,The Duke

Finn,"  [coughs] What are you here to do, stranger?",The Duke
Jake,  I've come for the princess. I'm an assassin!,The Duke
Princess Bubblegum,"  Um, guys?",The Duke
Finn,  Stand back! I will stop him! Hi-yah!,The Duke
Jake,  Hi-yah!,The Duke
Action, [Both Finn and Jake jump into the air. They pretend fight for a couple of seconds.],The Duke
Jake,  I will kill you! And raise your children as my own!,The Duke
Finn,  Hi-yaah!,The Duke

Jake,  Hah!,The Duke
Finn,"  Remember, it's just acting, Jake!",The Duke
Jake,"  [while running towards Princess Bubblegum] Sorry, dude! [Jake kicks Peppermint Butler to the side and stretches right in front of Princess Bubblegum.] Now, to kill you up. But wait, surely this cannot be the fair Princess Bubblegum! Where are her pink, flush cheeks? The long gooey hair? [Princess Bubblegum punches Jake to the ground.] Clearly, the princess travels elsewhere. [Out of character] Later, Bubblegum! [Jake jumps into the bush he was hiding in before.] Get out there, man!",The Duke
Duke of Nuts,  [behind bush] I don't know if I can do this.,The Duke
Jake,"  Go, go, go, go!",The Duke
Duke of Nuts,"  And that's how I, the Duke of Nuts, by disfiguring you beyond all recognition, humbly saved your life.",The Duke
Jake,"  [jumping out of bush] Yeah, alright!",The Duke
Finn,  [while still on ground from the impact of rock] Yeah!,The Duke
Princess Bubblegum,  What was the point of this little play again? [gasps] And why isn't the duke clapped in irons?!,The Duke
Duke of Nuts,"  She's right. Innocent or not, I should accept what's coming to me.",The Duke
Princess Bubblegum,  Peppermint Butler! [Peppermint Butler comes out of the shadows with golden handcuffs. He starts to walk towards the Duke of Nuts.],The Duke
Finn,"  Oh, no!",The Duke
Duke of Nuts,  Nuttin's going my way today.,The Duke
Action," [Peppermint Butler jumps up to handcuff the Duke of Nuts. However, he can't reach. Finn runs between them and keeps them apart.]",The Duke
Finn,  No!,The Duke
Princess Bubblegum,  Finn?,The Duke
Finn,"  The duke didn't throw that bottle! Ahh- Princess, I have something sucky to confess. I'm the one who threw the bottle. [Princess Bubblegum gasps.] I'm sorry, but I knew if I told you, you'd hate me forever!",The Duke
Princess Bubblegum,"  Hmm...well, I could never stay mad at you forever. And you seem genuinely penitent.",The Duke
Finn,"  I don't even know what that means, but thank you!",The Duke
Action, [The Duke of Nuts is laughing with Jake.],The Duke
Princess Bubblegum,  [points at them] But that doesn't douse my hatred for the duke!,The Duke
Finn,"  Yeah, what's up with that hate?",The Duke
Princess Bubblegum,  That jerk always empties out my pudding pantry!,The Duke
Finn,"  Aw, shucks. He just can't control himself around pudding. He goes cocoa-nuts for it! Because he has a pudding deficiency!",The Duke
Duke of Nuts,"  It's true, your majesty. I'm sorry for my medical condition.",The Duke
Princess Bubblegum,"  Oh, my, you poor man! Of course you're forgiven! [whispering to Finn] Yeah, I don't believe a word from him.",The Duke
Finn,"  [sighs] I'm really sorry about making you temporarily ugly, Princess. Especially before the Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty. I wish there was some way to make it up to you.",The Duke

Finn,  Why?,Freak City

Finn,  Why didn't you stop me?,Jake Suit
Jake,"  When you're in my body, it pushes out my brain, so I have no control.",Jake Suit

Action, [Finn groans],Jake Suit
Action," [The next scene only shows pictures taken every couple of seconds of inside and outside the tree fort, and puts them on fast forward to show the passage of time quickly.

Jake,"  No, I'm hungry.",Jake Suit
Finn,"  Yeah, I'm hungry too. How about a truce while you go make us some lunch?",Jake Suit

BMO,  Hello?,Be More

The hand drags the files into an onscreen trash can, deleting them. BMO's screen glitches, and BMO seems woozy. He chuckles and then looks normal. Scene switches to outside of the box. We hear BMO doing the same act once more and then BMO gets out of the box. He still seems dizzy. We see him selecting the file ""CORE SYSTEM DRIVES.sys"" and then deleting it.

Jake,  But nothing's moving down there. It's all shut down. What happened to this place?,Be More

Jake,"  Uh, what question?",Be More
DMO,  That question- [grunts with frustration],Be More
Jake,  I'm serious...,Be More

Finn,  So...you made BMO?,Be More
Jake,"  [Jake stretches to a large size.] Hey, you're not gonna reset our friend's personality, are you?",Be More
Moe,"  Huh? What? No...BMO's one of a kind. I built BMO to take care of my son. [A CMO brings over a screwdriver.] Oh, thank you. But I guess I never ended up dating any women. So, that's sad.

And then maybe even find somebody else's little boy to take care of.",Be More

Slime Princess, Is it because you haven't done much kissing? You don't have to be embarrassed by your innocence.,Love Games

Finn," [sighs] No, Slime Princess. Let's practice this smooch. [picks up Slime Princess]",Love Games

Blargetha, Uh-oh.,Love Games
Slime Princess," Blargetha, why would you make a fake husband? You're so hot.",Love Games
Blargetha," You don't know how hard it is to be this hot. Women don't want to talk to you, because they're intimidated, and guys don't want to talk to you, because they're too scared. You're alone in the hottest, most sexiest prison. So I stuck some olives in a glob of gelatin and called it my lover.",Love Games
Finn," Well, I'm sorry, Blargetha, but you're going to have to spend more time in your metaphorical prison in a real prison 'cause what you're doing is illegal.",Love Games

Finn, Okay. Cool. Informative. [whispers to Jake] What is he pointing at?,We Fixed a Truck

Finn," No, Princess, look! They're only bruised!",Rattleballs
Banana Guards," Hey, you hit me!",Rattleballs

Jake, Lich! I'm gonna kill you!,Wake Up
Action," [He starts punching his knuckles in a berserker rage. The Lich, proud of the life he has recently taken, starts to laugh evilly and mockingly. The cosmic crime—murdering a Wishmaster—committed, a space hole materializes like a television flickering on in the Time room, beyond it a Guardian from the Citadel, which, with a closed-eyed, emotionless face, does its duty as jailer and warden as it fires off its forehead crystallizer beam to cage the Lich in a frozen crystal, cutting off his laughter. Such is the justice of the Cosmic Guard. Jake stretches back to his normal state. The Guardian grabs the crystallized Lich, bound for the Citadel to rot in crystallostasis for the rest of eternity.]",Wake Up

Some people just make the world a worse place to be in just by being around, Jake. [The Lich starts to breathe gray smoke through the pink crystal. Bad omen.] That's right. Bad apples.

[He makes an angry sound while clenching his fists in the air, then he exhales.] Maybe we shouldn't even have come here—waah!? [Jake is beside Finn's dad while blowing on it. Black fire is melting the crystal cells and pillars.] Jake, what did you do?",Escape from the Citadel
Jake, It wasn't me! It came from up there!,Escape from the Citadel
Action, [Finn looks up to see The Lich's crystal cell fully gray and spreading his grayness and black fire to other cells with prisoners that are gray and have escaped or are still in their cells. The prison is being destroyed by this. Finn is shocked by this.],Escape from the Citadel

Finn," Hey, um... I... I wanted to ask you something. I... well... [Finn's dad jumps into the center.] Hey, wait up! [Jake brings himself and Finn into the center. They all swim upwards.] [underwater] Dad, wait! [At the top of the center, Finn, Martin and Jake gasp for air. Limbs of the guardians are everywhere.

Shelby," Whoa! [scene changes to Shelby writing on paper with him narrating] Kent proceeded his fantastic journey to me. It was all super good. But he had also partaken of the food of the underworld, and so he was compelled to return there by dewdrop law. That's what he said, at least.

Joshua," Margaret, you're in a family way now. You should take a backseat from investigations.",Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret," Oh, come on, Joshua. Even with this ankle-biter, I'm as quick as ever. Sure, my waist is bigger, but that just means more bullets in my ammo belt.",Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua," You're missing the point, sugar. What if something bad happens? Let's say we're out on the beat, fighting some lowlife. He takes a punch, you zig when you should've zagged, and oops!

Tree Trunks, [opens the door] Yes? Hello?,Joshua & Margaret Investigations

Tree Trunks, You could just ask for seconds.,Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Wyatt, But I want thirds and fourths! I want to stop when I want to stop!,Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Tree Trunks," Oh, Wyatt.",Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Wyatt," [crying] Oh, it's the only good part of my day.",Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua," Well, there you have it. The only monster here was this man's appetite for his wife's pie.",Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Tree Trunks," Oh, no. But the monster is real. He snuck up and rubbed my elbow while I was gardening. And Leftenant Candy Corn said it came in through the window and touched him on the chest. Oh! Oh, now I got myself all scared. W-won't you check around to make sure no one is out there?",Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua, Of course. Probably nothing more than a peeper. [they step out of the house] Ha! These country yokels are all just superstitious. I bet you that old elephant sees a monster a day.,Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret," Joshua, look! [puts her paw in the track] Something way larger than Wyatt made them. These tracks look real.",Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua," Hot cram! A peeping monster! Oh, this town would surely put up a collection to nab this guy. Oh, too bad you're preggo. We got to pass. [turns around and starts walking away]",Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret," Come on, Joshua! [follows the tracks]",Joshua & Margaret Investigations

[the monster screeches, gets on all four legs and runs behind a bush, leaving green slime behind it] Baby cakes! Oh, this is all my fault!",Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua," Uh, yeah, pretty much.",Joshua & Margaret Investigations

Joshua," Ah, good last meal. Okay, well, I got bit by a monster, a creature of the night. We both know what comes next for me. [picks up a sword and sets it on the table] Just make it snappy, darling.",Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret," [tearing up] Don't. [sniffles] Don't be melodramatic, Joshua. [holding the Book of Poisons] I've been doing some research. Listen here.

Puddin' Pie!",Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua, [groans] I'm fine. Just got to pop out and fetch that venom.,Joshua & Margaret Investigations

Hey, where's the fire, kiddo? You stay put. [goes back to Joshua, who is asleep and mumbling, Margaret holds up a walkie-talkie] So's I can keep tabs on you.

Joshua," You have to say ""over"" or I think you're still talking. Over.",Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret," [shining her flashlight at an old building that reads ""Pantheon of Savings"" ] Joshua, I've stumbled upon the beast's lair.

[shoots an arrow at the creature, the creature shapeshifts so he steps back before the arrow can hit him] What?!

Not yet! [tries reaching for her crossbow, but can't, the creature shapeshifts into a bigger creature and stretches its head towards Margaret, Margaret keeps trying to reach for her crossbow] Come on, come on! [grabs the crossbow's handle and shoots an arrow above the monster's head, hitting a box of baby items, sending them rumbling and crashing onto the monster. Defeated, the monster groans and shapeshifts into a baby with three eyes and coos] What? What's your angle, slick? You poison my hubby, then play the innocent?

Monster, [shifts its eyes left and right] Uh-huh.,Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret," Oh, no! I must've scared the dickens out of you! [the monster sits on the floor and coos] There, there, baby. I'm so sorry...[they both tear up] For this! [punches the monster's face and puts a test tube under its mouth, making its venom go into the tube. Margaret gets up and starts stepping out of the building] I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [the monster's eye stretches and looks out the door, the monster shapeshifts into its normal shape and chuckles in an evil ""You haven't seen the last of me"" tone, then shapeshifts into another shape and shoots lasers from its face diodes at the air, opening a portal.

Jake," [while watching the above] Lich life-sucks Prismo's dream host, eliminates Prismo forever. Ugh, it's mad gris bro. And then the Space Police, or whatever they're called, show up because boppin' Prismo is a cosmic crime. I remember feelin' like someone had peeled a layer away from my brain, and my reality was no longer anchored to any point of reference, and I had to fight to keep from being crushed under the weight of an unforgiving new paradigm of ultimate reality.

Finn, So... are you ready to come home?,Jake the Brick
Jake," Nah, I think I was just gonna keep being a brick for a while.",Jake the Brick
Finn, Umm... what are you doing again?,Jake the Brick
Jake," Finn, ever since I was little, I wanted to see what it's like to be a brick in a brick shack when the brick shack falls down. And this shack is gonna fall down. Just look at it. Like sandcastles in the sun, baby. [laughs] You're too young; you wouldn't understand.",Jake the Brick
Finn, [laughs] You're right. I don't understand. But I'm cool with your mystical journey or whatever. I'm gonna leave this walkie-talkie so we can stay in touch. Just in case.,Jake the Brick

Jake, [quietly] A bunny!,Jake the Brick
Action, [The rabbit hops over to a plant and starts digging it out.],Jake the Brick
Jake," Looks like our long-eared friend is on to something. Bunnies love to dig. He's making a supreme effort, and I think I can guess why.",Jake the Brick
Action, [The bunny digs the plant out enough to reveal it is a carrot.],Jake the Brick
Jake," That's right. A carrot, grown out here free and wild, probably the result of a seed pooped out by a passing bird.",Jake the Brick
Action, [The rabbit's attention is diverted by rustling in a bush.],Jake the Brick
Jake, But what's this? A mysterious rustling in the bush. Could mean trouble. Mr. Bunny seems to think so. His sensitive whiskers quiver at the hint of imminent danger.,Jake the Brick
Action, [The screen splits to show BMO bringing Finn a bowl of popcorn. They sit on the couch and listen to Jake's commentary through the walkie-talkie.],Jake the Brick
Jake," Unfortunately for Mr. Bunny, this is what nature is all about. It's a male deer. Not a threat to Mr. Bunny in the predatory sense, but still above him in the food chain. Mr. Bunny, wishing to avoid an encounter, hops away to safety.",Jake the Brick
Action, [The deer eats the carrot.],Jake the Brick
Jake," Wow, deers are jerks.",Jake the Brick
Finn," Hey, man. You know I can hear everything you say, right?",Jake the Brick
Jake, What?! Arrrrrgh! No! I had no idea.,Jake the Brick

Jake, Finn? Are you still there? Finn? BMO?,Jake the Brick
Action, [The rabbit drops what remains of the carrot and returns to its home in the roots of a tree.],Jake the Brick
Jake," Mr. Bunny retreats to its warren. Its homemade comfort is some consolation to help pass the hungry night. Twilight falls on the peaceful forest, a twilight unaware of the struggles it both soothes and conceals. The crickets begin to stir, rehearsing their musical rhapsodies. In the distance, flashes of heat lightning illuminate a purple summer sky. Even angry deer, at last, must come to rest. And so it is with our erstwhile antagonist, who has disappeared into a stand of trees, perhaps to dream of tomorrow's pointless battles.",Jake the Brick
Action, [Jake yawns and closes his eyes. He is awoken by a raging thunderstorm.],Jake the Brick
Jake," Oh, my Gob, it's a crazy storm! This might be it! This weather might knock the whole thing down! [laughs, then stops and looks at the rabbit]",Jake the Brick
Action," [The screen splits again, showing Finn with Starchie, who is broadcasting Jake's voice.]",Jake the Brick
Jake," If a definition of bravery exists, then this must be it. A lone bunny, facing off against the elements, ineffectually pushing around some twigs with his pink bunny nose, a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but sometimes that's all we have. The wind is beginning to pick up. It's becoming clear that Mother Nature has not just knocked on the door, she has come in, sat down, and poured herself a drink. Mr. Bunny has no friends, no family, no loved ones of any kind. The wind is really picking up now. Small puddles gathering around the entrance to Mr. Bunny's cozy home are beginning to grow in size and connect with one another. It won't be long now. But what's this?! Looks like this unflagging little hero of a bunny will have some help, though! A family of friendly beavers appears to have taken up the cause.",Jake the Brick
Action," [The rabbit leaves its home, and two beavers shield it from the rain with their tails. Finn writes ""Boost frequency?"" on a piece of paper and shows it to Starchie, who gives him a thumbs up. Finn crumbles up the paper and throws it toward the wastebasket, missing again. Starchie brings over three more microphones and positions them above the walkie-talkie.]",Jake the Brick
Jake," Often called nature's architects, these intrepid mammals are sparing no effort to shore up the endangered burrow. Here's an unusual sight. It's a Sea Lard! You'd expect to see a few mudscamps out in weather like this, but here we have a rare treat indeed. This little beauty is pretty far outside of her natural habitat, but I've heard it said by wise old salts schooled in ancient maritime lore that storms will sometimes blow them off course to a remarkable degree. Looks like we've got some pretty good evidence tonight. Yes, sir, sometimes those old sailors know what they're talking about. It's a triumph of experience versus the secondhand verities of musty academic tomes. This feisty Sea Lard is pitchin' right in to save the rabbit hole, belying its slothful reputation. She uses her prodigious swiveling behind to increase the size of the hole, while the beavers continue to reinforce the sides with straw and stick. Times like these, supposed cruelty and indifference of the natural world, all too often its most salient feature, pale before the nobler instincts of even our most humble kin.",Jake the Brick
Action," [Finn and Starchie fall asleep. At dawn, Jake continues his commentary with bags under his eyes.]",Jake the Brick
Jake," In the morning light, few signs remain of the summer storm that battered this idyllic glen. The beavers are finished with their work and are heading home. The Sea Lard looks like she's gonna wander the woods for a while. Maybe she'll find her way back to the ocean and write a novel about her experiences. Mr. Bunny is exhausted but can rest easy knowing that his home is secure. But alas, the bunny's rest is short-lived. The deer is back.",Jake the Brick
Action, [Finn and Starchie perk up.],Jake the Brick
Jake," The deer, perhaps confused by the antler-like appearance of Mr. Bunny's protective dam, is now testing the situation.",Jake the Brick
Action, [The deer pushes some twigs with its antlers.],Jake the Brick
Jake, The bunny is unsure of where this is going.,Jake the Brick
Action, [The deer suddenly stomps on the dam. The rabbit flees.],Jake the Brick
Jake," And with a single smash from the deer's powerful front hooves, the bunny's home is under attack! Mr. Bunny has hopped to safety and can only watch as the deer continues its relentless rampage on the only home he knows. A couple more mighty smashes, and the dam—the dam has been breached! Water is now flooding in! The deer continues its attack! This deer's misplaced rage, combined with its size and weight, is more than enough to bring down the weakened walls, which are now starting to give, aided by the unforgiving weigh from the tree above. Even Mr. Deer, in his blind fury, seems to sense what's about to happen as he steps to one side!",Jake the Brick
Action, [A huge crash is heard through the radio.],Jake the Brick
Jake, It's over. The warren has been destroyed.,Jake the Brick

Action, [The rabbit enters a hole in the hollow trunk.],Jake the Brick
Jake," He's on his feet, checking out his new surroundings—even the deer is impressed! As if confused by the events, he performs a comical double-take and retreats into the forest. Ladies and gentlemen, this bunny is indomitable!",Jake the Brick
Action, [Everyone listening celebrates.],Jake the Brick
Jake," [laughs] This bunny has the right attitude. Who cares about being a brick in a wall of a fallen-down shack? There's something bigger than that, and the bunny has answers. [stretches out of wall] Teach me, Mr. B!",Jake the Brick

Evergreen, See how it writhes? It aches for our extinction. It—!,Evergreen
Chatsberry," But Evergreen, even if the comet is as dangerous as you say, what can we possibly do?",Evergreen
Evergreen, We build a crown.,Evergreen
Chatsberry," ""A crown""?",Evergreen
Evergreen," Like none seen before, or ever after! A magical crown whose phantasmal circuitry will bond to its first bearer and grant him his one deepest wish... [yelling] to destroy the hideous comet which threatens our world! The good news is I already built the crown. The bad news it needs a power source. [yelling] The enchanted Ruby Eyes of the ancient lava dog, Magwood! And that's where you come in.",Evergreen
Chatsberry," Wait, wait! Evergreen, please. Wish Magic is really the real deal! This wish may see things in you you cannot see yourself. Can you truly say you know your heart's truest desire?",Evergreen
Balthus," I'm with Chatsberry. If this comet hits, we four indeed may perish. But the Elements we embody — Fire, Ice, Candy, and Slime — will live on! But a misplaced wish could cause irreversible damage to the very structure of existence!",Evergreen

Gunther," Sorry, Master Evergreen. [His head ducks out of his hiding place]",Evergreen
Evergreen, [sighs] And he expects me to teach him the ways of magic? As if.,Evergreen
Action," [The scene goes to the comet speeding towards Earth. It then changes to Evergreen riding on a palanquin being rolled along on top of pillars of ice. Gunther and Nina walk alongside him on the ground, with Gunther carrying his and Evergreen's things.]",Evergreen

Gunther," Sorry, Master, I'll put him back.",Evergreen
Action, [Gunther starts poking the imp creature with the bottle. It starts yelling.],Evergreen
Ice Imp," Heeeeey! Mmm, what?",Evergreen
Evergreen," Oh, never mind. [rolls a jar towards Gunther] Here, take the jar and find me some water. There's not enough moisture in the air for me to make an ice camp.",Evergreen
Gunther," Uh, Master? I'm sorry, I don't think I've seen any water at all today.",Evergreen
Evergreen, Just do it. Don't anger Daddy.,Evergreen
Gunther," Wait, are you my father?",Evergreen
Evergreen," No, but I stole your egg and mutated your brain—get going! [goes back to reading scroll]",Evergreen
Gunther, Hmm.,Evergreen
Action, [Gunther and Nina travel over a small hill of rocks to find a single source of water.],Evergreen
Gunther," Heh, you don't know where you're going, do you, girl? [Gasps] Ah, you're good at this. [The water pouring from a tiny rock structure that is low to the ground.] Man, you know who I like? Master Evergreen. He can do anything; one thing he's gonna do—he said he's gonna teach me magic. I can be like him!",Evergreen

Gunther," Nina, no!",Evergreen
Action, [Nina obediently curls by his side as he scoops the water by hand to fill the jar.] [Later Gunther and Nina make it back to the camp site.],Evergreen

Evergreen," Now, Gunther, listen to me. Don't follow me into Magwood's lair or else he'll melt your dome!",Evergreen
Gunther, [Disappointed] Yeah...,Evergreen
Action, [Evergreen walks around the corner.],Evergreen
Evergreen," [pointedly] Oh, Gunther! You should see this!",Evergreen
Gunther, Okay!,Evergreen
Evergreen," [Taps his nose] Gunther, no! You failed; he'll melt your dome.",Evergreen
Action," [Evergreen enters the lair, and sees a small Magwood sleeping on a column.]",Evergreen
Evergreen," [to himself] Not as grand as you once were, eh?",Evergreen
Action," [Evergreen steps on a small skeleton. The sound is enough to awaken Magwood, whose size increases.] [Outside of the lair, Gunther worryingly fidgets and cringes at the sounds he hears as his master and Magwood battle. He gets up and walks in to the lair.]",Evergreen
Gunther," Master Evergreen, I'm sorry, but I got worried. Yeeeee!!",Evergreen
Action," [An enraged Magwood has chased Evergreen to a hanging stalactite. The wizard blasts ice at the creature, who then bites at the stalactite. Evergreen falls into a pit as lava encroaches from above.]",Evergreen
Gunther," Ah! Oh, boy! Uh, maybe maybe maybe, maybe I can do magic! [Looks at his hands] Like Master Evergreen. Bah! Ice! Flah, sorry... [He steps back only to trip over the same skeleton as Evergreen. This again catches the attention of Magwood.]",Evergreen
Action," [The basket of bottles spill, and the bongo-playing ice imp is released.]",Evergreen
Gunther, Shh!,Evergreen
Ice Imp," That's what you get! [Magwood approaches and roars. Lava shoots from his mouth and lands on the imp, melting him] Heeeey....",Evergreen
Evergreen," [With Magwood distracted, he shoots a large block of ice.] Ice! [And then freezes the creatures head and quickly runs to the top. He stabs Magwood's head to obtain the jewels.] [Now walking away from the volcano, a frustrated Evergreen holds the jewels with Gunther slunk behind him.]",Evergreen
Evergreen, This is why I don't teach you magic.,Evergreen
Action, [Back at Evergreen's home],Evergreen
Gunther," [Petting a sleeping Nina] Niiina, Hiiina, Iiiina, Fiiina—",Evergreen
Evergreen," Gunther! The heck are you doing?! Get in here, Gunther! Oh, there you are, you blockhead. Quickly, take your position. We have precious little time. Once I complete the bonding chant, you deactivate the force field. [Gunther gives a thumbs up.] Bonding, bonding, three two one, you can do it, you can do it, three two one, bonding bonding. I did it! I— [A pounding sound comes from the doors. An angry Magwood, now in igneous rock form, appears. Evergreen blast him with ice but it has no effect as the creature has been cooled down] Come on, now, what did I ever do to you?! [Dodging an attack Magwood breaks a column] Watch the columns, stupid! Whoops! [Although he runs to another part of the room he puts his hands up in defense.] Easy now... [Magwood rears up and stomps, the ceiling cracks and a large piece of it falls on its head, knocking it unconscious] Oh, wow, did you see that?! [Evergreen too is now pinned under a piece of ceiling.] Ow, my bread balls!",Evergreen
Action," [With the room in ruins, the floor falls away. Gunther is knocked unconscious only to wake with his master calling to him.]",Evergreen

Gunther," I—wait, what?",Evergreen
Evergreen," No, no, there's no time! It must be you, Gunther!",Evergreen
Gunther, Me?,Evergreen
Evergreen," Don't worry, it's easy. Even a mush-head like you couldn't donk it up too bad. Just focus on your deepest truest wish, the destruction of the deadly comet, and the rest will take care of itself.",Evergreen
Gunther," [Places the crown on his head] My deepest truest wish... [Darkness overtakes him] Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no!",Evergreen
Evergreen," Gunther? Buddy? What are you wishing for down there? [Gunther sprouts white hair, a long nose and blue skin and shooting ice powers... all just like his master, Evergreen. If that isn't bad influence, Glob knows what is.] Gunther... no... That's the wrong wish! You've got to snap out of it! Use a concentration spell or, or a basic focusing charm—like I taught you... I mean, like I meant to teach you... I--",Evergreen

Man, what a dream. Do you guys ever have the dino-boy dream with the astero-- what? What... what is it? [He sees the penguins shivering in the corner, afraid] Something in my teeth? Something in my hair? Something in my nose? Something in my ear?",Evergreen
Action," [As Ice King says the latter lines, the scene changes to the outside of the Ice Kingdom. In the morning sky, a twinkling new light - easily mistaken for a star - glints into view. A fade in to the depths of outer space reveals the source of the light a new comet, light blue in color. Destination Earth.

Finn," Jake, so I just had this weird thought.",Astral Plane
Jake," Well, that's normal; people always have weird thoughts around campfires.",Astral Plane
Finn," Well, I don't know. Isn't is sort of strange that we keep pets? We kind of make them worship us.",Astral Plane
Jake, What?! Nah. [tosses stick into fire],Astral Plane

Jake, [turns towards Finn] What's wrong with tummy rubs?,Astral Plane
Finn," Yeah, tummy rubs are pretty great. [sighing he points upward towards a bright pulsating light] That one star is so crazy, looks like it's vibrating.

Action, [A porcupine has entered the house through a door flap. It looks around and heads towards the kitchen area],Astral Plane
Bounce House Princess," [Loudly gasps] Oh my glob, oh my glob, oh my glob, oh my glob! [She runs to a far wall and rips the wallpaper, revealing a ""Panic Room"" door] [She quickly inputs the code] six four three two one! [She looks behind her to see the porcupine licking a cracker].",Astral Plane
Finn," [Floats towards the panic room. He annoyingly looks at the porcupine] Dude, what's your deal? [The porcupine not hearing Finn simply continues to eat crackers.]",Astral Plane

[Finn's body is pulled upwards towards the ceiling a loud pop is heard]",Astral Plane
Finn," [Now floating above the princess's cave] Gosh, I hope BHP's okay, I feel bad for just splittin' like that. Maybe they sorted it out, they could have stuff in common.

Finn, [Floating above the party goers he spots the Ice King] What the? Ice King?,Astral Plane

[He watches as he and the other Cloud People slip through the clouds and fall towards the grown]. Eh, this party was weak anyway.",Astral Plane
Finn," [Floating higher above the clouds] Poor Simon. Poor Simon, I guess? Poor Simon... sort-of? It's like some part of him wants to be a sad wong-lord. [Floating higher] But why would anyone want that? Is there some... incentive? [A strumming of a guitar is heard. Finn spots Marceline who is floating in the air playing the guitar and singing to herself]",Astral Plane
Action, [Now above Marceline and continuing upwards towards the stratosphere],Astral Plane
Finn," Sheesh, I wonder if being a sad loner gives you more raw material to form song ideas. Is that where creativity comes from? From sad-biz? [Floating above the earth] I am so high up now. I am so high up, there is no ""high up"". It's all just... [looks up to see blue creatures circling in space] Whoa! What the--? Whoooa! [Floats in the middle of the circle] Space Lards!

Space birth! [A shot of the comet and Finn is pulled upward out of the giant lard] Okay, here we go! Whoa! [Exiting out the top of the lard's head] Bye, guys. Oh, that was creative and it wasn't sad either so maybe birth is the greatest statement in all the universe. [The space lard new-born floats under Finn] Hey, baby, ya' gonna give me a boost?

Grob Gob Glob Grod," It doesn't make sense. Every 1,000 years, the Catalyst Comet mysteriously reincarnates itself and collides with Earth, bringing with it an agent of change. But the comet has never been so off schedule - and it's never freakin' hit Mars!",Astral Plane

Grob Gob Glob Grod," Well, it’s not enough to have created something amazing, right? What if I just let my Martian supersociety go to butt?",Astral Plane
Finn, But what's it worth if we're all gonna get blowed up right now? [Grob Gob Glob Grod suddenly takes off into space],Astral Plane
Star Man," Whoa! What are you doing?! [looking through the machine's scope] [Grob Gob Glob Grod head straight at the Comet screaming and crashes into it, sacrificing their synthetic lives for the Red Planet in a blaze of cosmic glory.
