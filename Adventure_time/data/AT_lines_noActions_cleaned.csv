Lady Rainicorn@나 잡아봐봐~ ("Catch me if you can.")@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Alright. Let me just add three more drops of explosive diarrhea.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn and Princess Bubblegum@Oooo...@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Hey Princess Bubblegum, when we bring the dead back to life, will it be filled with worms?@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@No. If my decorpsinator serum works, all the dead Candy People will look as young and healthy as you do.@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Pick up that platter, tough guy.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Old Mr. Cream Puff?@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@We used to date.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Something's happening! Come on, come on...@Slumber Party Panic

Finn@Algebraic!@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Wait, something's wrong.@Slumber Party Panic
Zombie Mr. Cream Puff@Sugar!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn and Princess Bubblegum@Ew!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Hey, look, the decorpsinator serum is working!@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@No, this is wrong. They're not coming back to life--they're still dead! The decorpsinator serum--it's incomplete!@Slumber Party Panic
Zombie Love Heart@Rah. Must eat sugar!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@You're grounded, Mister.@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, this is really bad. They're going to be attracted to the Candy Kingdom!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Why?@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Because the Candy People are made of sugar, ya ding dong!@Slumber Party Panic
Zombie Mr. Cream Puff@Gimme some sugar, baby.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Chew on this!@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Good one, Finn. Quickly, to the kingdom!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Get a life!@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@All citizens of the Candy Kingdom! Report to the palace, immediately!@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Whoa!@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Hurry, sweet citizens.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Alright, you heard the princess, everyone in! Alright, no pushing, come on!@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Dude, what's up?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@The princess will explain everything. Tree Trunks, get those hot buns in here, girl.@Slumber Party Panic
Tree Trunks@Oh, I hope it's not bad news.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Did we get everyone?@Slumber Party Panic
Manfried@All present and accounted for.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Thanks, Manfried.@Slumber Party Panic
Manfried@You're welcome.@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Citizens, we are assembled here in the candy foyer for a momentous announcement. Tonight we are all going to have... a slumber party!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@What?!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Wait! What about the zom--?!@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Go ahead and start partying.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@But, Princess, the Undead--@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@We'll be right back, everyone.@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Whooo!@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Finn, the Candy People can't know about the zombies.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Wha?!@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@If they knew, they would flip out.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@What do you mean "flip out"?@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@I mean they would flip out.@Slumber Party Panic
Starchie@Princess? It's me, Starchie the gravedigger. I brought you a larger corpse shovel. Oh, Princess? Well, I'll just wait for you here, then. By the mausoleum. With my back turned. And my defenses lowered.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Candy People explode when they get scared?!@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Not telling the Candy People about the zombies is so important that you need to promise, Royal Promise, not to let anyone find out about the zombies, ever.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Okay, sure.@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@No, Finn. You have to Royal Promise.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Yes, I Royal Promise.@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Now I must cloister myself in the lab and finish the equation to my decorpsinator serum. You keep the candy folk distracted and ignorant. Can you do that?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Yes, your highness.@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Good. Don't tell anyone about the zombies. Never ever.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@No, wait. Can I at least tell Jake?@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Tell me about what, dude?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@You know, about the outbreak of zom--@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Alright, what's going on?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Uhh, nothing at all, buddy!@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Hey, dude. I think you and Bubblegum are up to something.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Ahha ah, what? No, no way.@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Whoa, you guys are up to something. Is it some sort of prank? Can I get in on it?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Who wants to play "Truth or Dare"?@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Hmm...@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Ok, Chocoberry, you may ask someone to tell a deep truth or a saucy dare.@Slumber Party Panic
Chocoberry@Mr. Cupcake, truth or dare?@Slumber Party Panic
Mr. Cupcake@Dare.@Slumber Party Panic
Chocoberry@I dare you to take off your wrapper.@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Hey seriously, man. I'm your bro. Bros are supposed to tell bros everything all the time. What are you and Bubblegum up to? Is everything alright?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Yep! Fine! Everything is great! Heh, heh. Except for that. Whoa.@Slumber Party Panic
Peppermint Butler@I didn't know he was chocolate.@Slumber Party Panic
Mr. Cupcake@Jake, truth or dare?@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Truth.@Slumber Party Panic
Mr. Cupcake@Do you prefer chocolate or fudge?@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@I can't eat chocolate or fudge 'cause I'm a dog and they'd probably kill me, but hmmmmm probably... neither. Finn! Truth or dare?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Dare! Haha!@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@I dare you... to tell me the truth about what's going on in your mind. What were you and Bubblegum talking about when you were alone together?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Umm, ahh, the truth is, ahhh...@Slumber Party Panic
Hallucination of Princess Bubblegum@You promised you wouldn't freakin' tell anyone! Oh, you're so cute, Finn.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Ahhh... the truth is... that I'd rather play Dodge Socks!@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@I'm not playing dodge socks 'til you stop dodging my questions. Hey... Old Mr. Cream Puff? Isn't he dead?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Hey, give me my sock back! Dodge Socks was a bad idea!@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Whoa. Look dude, just tell me what's up, 'cause you are crazier than a cannonball tonight.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Oh, my goodness! Princess hasn't finished the equation and the zombies are here!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@I, uh, she just want this slumber party to be super fun, and if I did have something to tell you, then I would in a second, and it would make my life easier, unless there was something stopping me, like a promise, but there isn't, so I won't, so it's cool.@Slumber Party Panic
Zombie@Sugar!@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@What? You lost me.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Umm... Hey, you know what time it is?@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Adventure time?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@No, time for Seven Minutes in Heaven! You're first.@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Really?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Lady Raincorn! In the closet with Jake!@Slumber Party Panic
Lady@뭐? 나? 웃겨 정말. 그래, 좋아. 하자. ("What? Me? You gotta be kidding me. Okay, then. I'll play.")@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Okay, okay, alright. But in seven minutes, I'm gonna come out and make you spill your beans, Finn.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@I can't hear you all the way in heaven!@Slumber Party Panic
Chet@Umm, does anyone else hear that?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@What? Hear what? I, I don't hear anything.@Slumber Party Panic
Chet@I hear something I don't understand... and it makes me scared!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@What? No, Chet. Everybody, wait. What noise? You mean this noise?@Slumber Party Panic
Chet@Oh.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Yeah! Dance it! Bust it up! Uh! Uh! Uh! Oh!@Slumber Party Panic
Chocoberry@What is this game you are playing at now, Finn?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Uhh, it's... Blockado. Haha, the game of barricades. Come on, let's block all the entrances and windows!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Alright, this is not a permanent solution. Think Finn, how can you keep everyone from finding out?@Slumber Party Panic
Manfried@Find out about what, Finn?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Manfried, the talking piñata! Your convient appearance gives me a great idea. Everyone, grab a stick! New game! We're gonna smash some piñatas!@Slumber Party Panic
Manfried@What?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Except for you, Manfried.@Slumber Party Panic
Manfried@Oh, thank goodness.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Now everybody don these blindfolds. Thanks, Taffy Girl.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Alright, everybody, get together. I'm hanging the piñatas... They're all around you. Smash the piñatas!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Yeah! You guys are on fire!@Slumber Party Panic
Chocoberry@Oh, it is so tasty.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Yes! We did it! My improbable plan worked!@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Whew!@Slumber Party Panic
Lady@안녕! ("Hello!")@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Seven minutes up yet? Whoa! What the nuts happened here?!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Oh, we killed all the zombies that Princess Bubblegum and I raised from the dead.@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Really!?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Jake? What's going on?@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@What? Huh? Oh, Finn! Did you break your Royal Promise?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Yeah, but, I mean, all the zombies are dead. The Candy People won't freak out. What's the big deal?@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@This is really, really bad, Finn. You can't break Royal Promises. Never, ever, never. No matter what, forever.@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@The Guardians of the Royal Promise are coming for us.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn and Princess Bubblegum@Whoa!@Slumber Party Panic
Guardian 1@Finn the Human. You have broken a Royal Promise for which the penalty is trial by fire.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@That's stupid.@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Wait! He's my friend! Isn't there another option?!@Slumber Party Panic
Guardian 1@Yes. Because you care for the promise-breaker, we will give him a less hot trial. You must now answer...@Slumber Party Panic
Guardian 2@...Math questions!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Mathematical!@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Finn, you're terrible at math.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Awww.@Slumber Party Panic
Guardian 1@Now, solve this!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Uhh....@Slumber Party Panic
Guardian 2@Oh, wait, wait, I thought of a better one. @Slumber Party Panic
Guardian 1@Yes! Two plus two. Solve it or die.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Uhh. Four, right?@Slumber Party Panic
Guardian 1@Oh, correct.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@What's happening, Princess?@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@You've defeated the broken royal promise! The Gumball Guardians are resetting!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Slamacow! That was tops! Who's not good at math? I was all "Four!"@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Four, four... Four, four, four... That's it! The answer was so simple, I was too smart to see it!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@You're welcome!@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@'4' is the last figure I need to perfect my decorpsinator serum.@Slumber Party Panic
Revived Zombie@Golly!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Woohoo! Yeah!@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@This is messed up, but sweet.@Slumber Party Panic
Lady Rainicorn@진짜로. ("Truly it is.")@Slumber Party Panic
Candy Person 1@Uncle Chewy!@Slumber Party Panic
Candy Person 2@Grandma!@Slumber Party Panic
Ice Cream Lady@Former dead relative!@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Starchie!@Slumber Party Panic
Starchie@Mornin'.@Slumber Party Panic
Jake@Man, you broke a Royal Promise? You're nuts. All you had to do is say that it was a royal secret. I know what's up.@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@I hope you grasp the full consequences of breaking promises.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Heck yeah! If I break a Royal Promise, I get to fight zombies, throw slumber parties, awake Gumball Guardians and... and...@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Alright, alright.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@And reverse death itself!@Slumber Party Panic
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, you are adorable. But keep your promises, okay?@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@I will, Princess.@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Starchie, you're not a zombie.@Slumber Party Panic
Starchie@I can't help it. Flesh is delicious!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@You're delicious!@Slumber Party Panic
Starchie@Don't squeeze me! I'll fart!@Slumber Party Panic
Finn@Whoop! Huh?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Whoop!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Whoopiiieee...@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Princess Bubblegum@Cheers, Lumpy Space Princess.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Bouncing!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Princess, this tea party sucks in a big way! But thanks for the invite!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, don't worry, Finn. The Mallow Tea Ceremony takes years to master.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Princess! I think I just now mastered it! One more bounce. Alright! Unh! Tea partying's hard, huh, Jake?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Oof! Yes!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@What?! No way! It's super easy!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Lumpy Space Princess, you big faker! You're floating, not bouncing!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Fine. I'll prove it. Huh? Ah! Oh, no! Oh, snap!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@AAAAAGH!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh. Sorry I bit your leg.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@You're still biting me!!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, my gosh. Oh, right. Sorry.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Dude! Your leg!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@This is... new. It's nothin' ominous, though. Just a bump.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Nah, that's no bump. It's the early stage of the lumps.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Is it serious?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@It just means he's changing into a Lumpy Space guy, on account of my bite. It's just like, um, y'know... werewolf rules? Ar, rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Oh, no!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@What? You think I'm gonna turn all lumpy like her? Get outta here. Wha? Finn, I think I'm freakin' out!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Calm down, bud! I'll... I'll sock the lumpiness outta ya!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Princess Bubblegum@Hey, now! Royal intervention! Surely there must be an antidote to the lumps.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Yeah. There's an antidote, but you have to go all the way to Lumpy Space to get it. And Jake has to use it by sunset.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Princess Bubblegum@What happens if he doesn't take the antidote by sunset?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@He'll be lumpy, like, forever.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@LSP, please! Can you tell us how to reach Lumpy Space?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Yeah, I mean, there's a portal nearby. I can show you whenever.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn and Jake@Take us now! Take us now!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Princess Bubblegum@I should not have drunk that much tea!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Don't go telling everyone about this portal or whatever. It's kind of a secret.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Where is it?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Portal's that Frog and mushroom.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Frog@Password, please.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Whatevers2009!!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Frog@Good day, Princess. Is your father okay with you entering Lumpy Space with two... non-Lumpers?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Just say yes! Yes, yes, yes!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Yeah, whatever, fine.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@AAAAH!! Whoa... Lumpy Space. So, where's the antidote?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Hold it. First, you should check out my house. It's, like, kind of lame, but way less lame than, like, your house.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Uh, could you skip to the part where you tell us where the antidote is?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@It's up there at Makeout Point.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@That's so close! We can run there in no... ...time. Aww, what?!! It's, like, a million-mile fall into space!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Yeah. You have to travel by car in my world, or else you'll fall into the Lumpy Abyss.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space King@Daughter!! Have you brought smooth people into our domain?!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@I had to, Dad... I'm trying to help them, so don't lumping yell at me!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Queen@WHAT DID YOU SAY?! What did you just say?!?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@I SAID, "LUMP OFF," MOM!!! @Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Uh...@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@WHAT?!?!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Vroom vroom??@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, yeah. I need to borrow the car.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space King@You have made your mother cry for the last time, daughter! You are hereby banned from using the royal car!!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Shucks! I lumping hate them! I'm really, really sorry, Finn. But I can't help you because my parents are horrible idiots.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Don't you know anyone else with a car?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@My friend Melissa has a car. But she's dating my ex-boyfriend Brad.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Call her NOW.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Hmm. Call BFF 66.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Melissa@Hello?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Hey, Melissa. What's up?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@What's she saying?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@I'm asking her, jeez! Melissa, just listen!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Melissa@Have you forgotten what day it is?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Melissa. I'm trying to help out some friends.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Melissa@Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, Glob. I forgot.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@What'd she say?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance! It's gonna be so flipping awesome!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@LSP, we don't have time for this. Ask for the ride, LSP.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh— Wha?!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Melissa, you should totally drive us to Makeout Point to make out with hot boys!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Melissa@LSP, you're so baaaaad... be there in a sec!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Biyah.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Hmm.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Sorry. But Jake's lumpiness is worsening!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Actually, I think I'm beating it back with sheer willpower! Oh, my.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Yeah, whatever. Just don't mess with my phone again.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Melissa@Hi!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Ugh... OKAY! Let's go, let's go, let's go!!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Aw, Finn, this music ducks, right? Ah. I love this song. We should totally TP Shandala's house! Gracious! That was terrible! Finn, if you can't save me from the lumps... if I do turn... if I become lumpy like them, I want you to—@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@It's not gonna come to that. But if it does, I'll bury you beneath the nicest, most shadiest tree!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm saying that if I go totally lumpy, then I want you to get used to lumpy Jake. What did you think I was sayin'?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Oh, um... Heh heh. CAN'T THIS CAR GO ANY FASTER?!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Melissa@We're already here! Hi, Finn.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@We've been here for, like, five minutes.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Finally! Huh? This doesn't look like Makeout Point.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Melissa@This is Brad's house. You wanted a ride to Makeout Point? You think I want to make out with you?!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Uh...@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Melissa@Well, maybe I do, but... wait. I HAVE A BOYFRIEND, FINN!!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@LSP, we gotta hurry! Jake's running out of time!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Hey. This is hard for me, too. I mean, I used to eat chili cheese fries with Brad... so there's gonna be a lot of romantic tension on this ride!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Brad@Hey.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Melissa@Oh, Braaaaad...@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Brad@You miss me yet, LSP?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Scooch over, Finn. I'm gonna sit in the back.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@This is it.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Let's go!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Wait. Watch yourself, Finn. The guys who use the antidote up here are notorious for being... smooth posers.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@What does that mean?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@It just means what it means. Hurry. Get the antidote so we can get outta here.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Thanks, LSP.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@BUUUUMPS.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Um... bumps.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Uh, yeah, bumps.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Aw, man!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Hey, guys. Lookin' smooth!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Glasses@Really? You think we're smooth?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Well, mostly you in the center, but yeah!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Monty@Why are you sucking up to us?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@My best friend needs an antidote for lumpiness.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lenny@Chyah, lumpiness suuucks. Hey, Monty, time's up, sphere-hog! My turn!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@So the antidote is in that orb you were sitting on!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lenny@This orb is the antidote, bruh.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Can my friend borrow it?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lenny@Yeah, sure, as long as you give it right back.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Hammacow. Thanks, fellas.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@What's taking so long? Did those smooth-heads give you the orb already, or what?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Wait!!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lenny@Is this another friend of yours??@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@What do you care? Just give 'em the antidote already, and stop being such a poser.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Monty@Sorry, kid. We changed our minds.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Why did you have to say all those rude things to them?!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@What? I was helping you.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Thanks a lot! They were right about to hand over the antidote!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@You're welcome a lot.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@You insulted them! And they got mad! And now Jake's gonna be lumpy forever! This is all your fault!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@Wow. Now I know how you really feel. I was just trying to help, but whatever. No. No, not whatever! I know I mess things up sometimes, but I'm really trying! And you guys are supposed to be my friends! Not like the fake ones I have here! So do what you want! I'm going to Promcoming! Are you coming or not, Lumpy Jake?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@No. Because no matter how messed up and lumpy I get, this guy never turns his back on me! Oh, yah. Right behind ya. Just gotta turn my back on this guy.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@JAKE! IT'S ALMOST SUNSET!! Jake... I didn't save him... I... I'LL KILL YOU, LUMPY SPACE!!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Monty@Jam on, man!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Huh? I thought you guys left!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Monty@We were drawn back by your plaintive wail. We dig your directionless fury.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Um, thanks.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Monty@Respect. Here. Take it. Win your girl back!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Yeah, there's no girl. But there is still time to save Jake! Do you guys know where Promcoming is?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Monty@Promcoming takes place way down on that land-lump.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Awesome. Do any of y'all have wheels?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Monty@Nah. We were all ditched here just like you.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Well... you think I can make it to that land-lump if I jumped off this cliff?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Monty@You kidding?! A smoothie like you will plummet right into the eternal void!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@What if I was lumpy? Could I float over?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lenny@No, no! It's too dangerous!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Glasses@I'd say there's a 50/50 chance of you making it!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@That's good enough for me. Now bite me!!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Yes! I can feel the multiple bites accelerating the lumpification process! I'm starting to float!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lenny@Don't jump, guy!!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@I have to! For my buddy. RAAAAAAGH!!!!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Glasses@Wow. He's insane.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Ah, I made it! And there he is!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Yeah! Promcoming! Yeah! Cool!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Jake! I'm mostly lumpy now! And I totally think you should sit on this sphere!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@No!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Sit on it!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@No!!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Please, Jake! You're my best friend! Just sit on the sphere!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Chyah! I remember you! You're just a smoothie wannabe lumpy poser!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Sit on it!! Before I turn completely lumpy!!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@NO!!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Oh, no! I can feel the lumpiness... about to consume me!! Oh, yah. Being lumpy's the best.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Hey. Stop talkin' to yourself, dumb guy. Take your ball and get outta here.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Fine. I don't want you to have it anyway.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@So I can't have it now, eh?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@That's right. It's mine.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@GIMME THAT BALL!!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@NO! You can't have it!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@I want it! Give it to me!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@You want it that bad? Go get it, then!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Bumps, bi— Oh, I'm not lumpy anymore! Oh, no. Finn buddy! You gotta sit on this!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@No! You can't make me! Smooth—OOF!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Finn! Hey, Finn! Hey, buddy! Finn@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Huh?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Hey, dude. We made it.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Man... There's something cold under my butt. Oh! The antidote! Just in time, too! LSP, I'm sorry I blew up at you before. I didn't mean it. I was just really stressed out.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Lumpy Space Princess@You know, it's fine. You and Jake can make it up to me by dancing this last dance with me.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Sounds good to me. Whaddaya say, Jake?@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@That sounds totally lame.@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Jake@Heh heh heh. I'm just kiddin'. Let's dance!@Trouble in Lumpy Space
Finn@Oh, no, our sled's broken! Hey, let's build one out of snow!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@What are you doing, Jake?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Jake@Sleds are for suckers. Just ride on my gut.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Okay!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Jake@Switch!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Switch back! Switch back!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)

Ice King@You know why I'm here? Do you know what "Ice King" means?!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Jake@Yeah, I know what "Ice King" means A big nerd!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Oh ho oh! Holy cow!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@It means I'm King of Ice! This is my domain! And you are violating Ice World law--trespassing!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Jake@Come on, brother! We're just trying to beat the heat.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)

Slime Princess@We're all prisoners, Finn.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Ice King!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@What?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Why are you keeping these girls prisoners, jerk?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@You don't understand! I collect princesses because I want to marry one.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Jake@Well, why'd you capture six of them if you just want to marry one?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@I'm collecting them all first to be sure I make the right choice. You're both too young to understand, but marriage is a serious thing and lasts forever. You can't just rush into it, you know?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Ice King, don't do this. Just let the girls go. They don't want to be here.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Of course they do! I would have killed them already if they didn't want to be here. Right ladies? Zzhp Zzhp.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Princesses@Mm-hm.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Don't worry, princesses. I pledge that Jake and I will protect each and everyone of you and furthermore I see all of you happily married to whatever sweet thing y'all want to be married to!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Slime Princess@Yay!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)

Finn@My flute!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Jake@Aw, nuts, dude! You broke it when we tried picking the lock to that sad ogre's heart!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Darn it!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Nice try, boy! Princesses, did you see? Did you see Finn fail?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Jake@Don't worry, Finn. I'll get us out of here with Key Hand! Hah-hah!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Oh, no you won't!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Jake!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Eat it.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Jake@I... I'm okay.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Ice King! You better either set us free or come in here and fight me 'cause otherwise I'm gonna flip out!!!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Oh, are you trying to hit me? Well, excuse me because I have to go potty in the bathroom.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@ICE KING!!!...@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Jake@Finn!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)

Jake@I'm fine, buddy. Calm down and tend to the princesses.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Oh my gosh. I'm sorry, princesses. Slime Princess, are you alright?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Slime Princess@He's held us here for weeks, questioning us about our favorite sports and quirky behavior. I've tried to tell him as little as possible.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@I understand. And, Lumpy Space Princess, how do you fair?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Lumpy Space Princess@I'm bored, and I'm not having any fun.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@What? Not having any fun? But last night I read you the story of "Baby Whatsit and the Bottle Prince."@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Lumpy Space Princess@That wasn't fun. That was lame.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Other princesses, do you feel the same way?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Well, here, watch. I'll show you. We'll have some fun. Fun's my middle name.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Here, now, Wildberry Princess. I need you to play this.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Wildberry Princess@I don't know how.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Well, come here, I'll teach you. Put your hand through the bars, atta princess, and uh...@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Wildberry Princess@I don't think I can.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Just play it like I showed you.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Leave her alone, Ice King!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@PLAY IT OR I'LL SQUISH YOU INTO JUICE!!!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Wildberry Princess@Oh dear!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Yeah, keep playing it. Now everyone pick up an instrument and play it. Oh, this is going to be so much fun!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Jake@What are you thinking, Finn?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@I've almost devised a plan. I'm gonna let him drum till' I've finalized the details in my mind.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Oh, that was fun!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Ah! It was fun! Hey, you should get some more fun stuff.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@You're right! Good idea, Finn.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@"Good idea," indeed.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@I hope they think I'm fun.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Alright. I've got a plan on how to get out of here. First everyone needs to be dancing and laughing and saying fun stuff like "Whoopee"! Okay, when the Ice King comes back, everyone play it up, like we want him to come inside the jail and party with us and when he steps inside, I'm gonna beat the tar out of him with these... ...while you all take care of Jake. Everyone on board with this?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Jake@Sweet plan, dude!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Lumpy Space Princess@I think by everyone saying "whoopee" the plan won't work cause he'll know we're faking it.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Good point, Lumpy Space Princess.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Lumpy Space Princess@I'm gonna say something fun like "Oh yeah, I'm having a fun time! Oh my gosh, havin' the best time I've ever had in my entire life!"@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Make way for the fun tray! Whoa, what's happening?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@What is this?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@We're having fun! Whoopee!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Because I left the room?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Jake@Because they like it here. Because they like you. Because you're a really fun guy!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@I don't get this.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@He's not buying it. Dance harder.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Lumpy Space Princess@Come on in here and party.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Wanna dance with us, Ice King? Come on!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Me? You want to dance with me?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh yeah! Whoo! Woohoo!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Wow! Yes! Yes! Whoopee!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Wait, no! Don't leave! I'll kill you all! Why are you doing this? Everyone was finally warming up to me.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@No! That is not the case! You're nuts, man! And I don't know how to help you! Probably because I'm just a simple dude. So maybe you should talk to someone with more life experience, like Jake!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Jake@Whoa, whoa, whoa, Finn, what are you doing? Don't dump the Ice King on me!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@But you gotta get it in you're head, man! Putting princesses in jail is wrong!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Bah! Finn, you just ruined my chances with 5 or 6 potential wives! For that you will... Ohh! Oh, my beard.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Why do people not like me? Is it because I'm a magic user or is my beard too shaggy? I try so hard to be a good husband for girls. What's wrong with me?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Comic Owl@Hoo. You're a sociopath.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Who are you? I know. You're probably a--a big nerd! Why don't you try being cool like me? Star dust is so ticklish! What happened? Princesses? Ohhh...@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Slime Princess@Thank you, Finn.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@You're welcome, Slime Princess!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Slime Princess@And remember when you vowed to marry us to the thing of our choosing?@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Yeah...@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Slime Princess@Well, I'd like to marry you.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Everyone else@Ooooh!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Oh, heh heh, well how 'bout that... Jake, help me!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Jake@Oh, eh... Slime Princess, you shouldn't marry Finn. He pees his pants constantly. All the time.@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Princesses@Ewww!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Slime Princess@Oh, gross! Put me down! Put me down!!!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn@Heh heh, I'm sorry. Jake!@Prisoners of Love (Adventure Time)
Finn and Jake@Swords! Yeah, swords! Whoo!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Oh, men and their swords... You boys, stop horsing around with my apples!@Tree Trunks
Both Finn and Jake@Aw,Tree Trunks!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Now, come on over! I baked y'all an apple pie.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Yeah, apple pie!@Tree Trunks
Jake@Whooo-hoo-hoo!@Tree Trunks
Finn@I'm gonna eat it all before you even GET there!@Tree Trunks
Jake@Noooooo!@Tree Trunks
Finn@Apple pie!@Tree Trunks
Jake@Don't let him eat it all!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Now, you boys sit down and behave yourselves. Oh!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Shoo, fly! Get off my apple pie! Huh! A fly landed on my pie. That's no good. Bye-bye.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Why are you throwing the pie away?@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Flies wanted it, they can have it.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Anyways, don't y'all worry 'cause the new pie is coming in the wag of a lamb's tail.@Tree Trunks
Finn and Jake@New pie?@Tree Trunks
Finn@Woohoo! Pie, yeah!@Tree Trunks
Jake@Yeah! Wowowowowo@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Here you are.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Wow.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Come on, go ahead.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@What you think?@Tree Trunks
Jake@Best apple pie ever!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Oh, Jake, thank you, but that ain't the best apple pie.@Tree Trunks
Finn@What are you talking about, Tree Trunks? What can be better than your apple pie?@Tree Trunks
Jake@You ate all the pie...@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Finn, what would you do if you could do anything?@Tree Trunks
Finn@Anything? Well, I'd catch a shooting star, travel to outer space and fight space monsters!@Tree Trunks
Jake@I'd carve my face on the moon so the moon would look like my face!@Tree Trunks
Finn@What would you do, Tree Trunks?@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@I would go pick an apple.@Tree Trunks
Finn@...Lame.@Tree Trunks
Finn@I'm sorry. I mean, it's just you pick apples every day.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@This apple ain't like the apples that I pick. They say it's the apple of apples; rarest kind of all. Legends call it the Crystal Gem Apple.@Tree Trunks
Jake@That sounds awesome!@Tree Trunks
Finn@Where is it?@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@I've heard that it grows at the deepest end of the Evil Dark Forest.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Whoo! Tree Trunks you gotta go pick that apple!@Tree Trunks
Jake@YEAH!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@What? Me? Oh, no I'm just a cute little elephant. I'm not cut out for adventuring.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Tree Trunks! This is your dream! Think about eating that apple with your own mouth.@Tree Trunks
Jake@Or your trunk.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Imagine the flavor.@Tree Trunks
Jake@And your satisfied face.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Really? You think I can handle the Scary Dark Forest?@Tree Trunks
Finn@Yeah, and we'll help you.@Tree Trunks
Jake@We love you, Tree Trunks.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Okay. I'll do it. Call me... Adventurer Tree Trunks.@Tree Trunks
Finn & Jake@Yeah, Tree Trunks!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@I love being so high up from the ground!@Tree Trunks
Jake@Psst, I can take you even higher on my shoulders.@Tree Trunks
Finn@No, Jake. She has a weak heart.@Tree Trunks
Jake@Oh, yeah.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Ewww, why is this ground all squishy?@Tree Trunks
Jake@Whatever it is, I'm liking it. Oh, yeah!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@I wanna try!@Tree Trunks
Finn@Okay. I'm cool with you letting you do whatever you want.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Heeheehee! It's like some cookie dough!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Oh, hello there.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Uhh, Tree Trunks, stay away from that.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Ugh, you're gonna get it, wall of flesh.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@An eye and a mouth. Well, I think I got the perfect thing for him or her... stickers!@Tree Trunks
Finn@Careful, Tree Trunks, this thing is evil.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Here's a rainbow sticker, and here's a scratch-and-sniff sticker. Smells just like a pickle. Oh, and this one is a holographic unicorn, but it doesn't have a horn.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Oh, now, whatcha doing?@Tree Trunks
Finn@Huh? Tree Trunks!@Tree Trunks
Jake@Whoo!@Tree Trunks
Finn@You better stay in that tree, baby. Um, Tree Trunks were you putting stickers on that evil monster?@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Yes, I thought it needed some tender love and affection. Oh, what a pretty butterfly!@Tree Trunks
Finn@Tree Trunks? Ugh. Jake, I just realized that Tree Trunks is old and bonkers. We can't take her through this Evil Dark Forest.@Tree Trunks
Jake@Nah, she'll be fine.@Tree Trunks
Finn@But the monsters?@Tree Trunks
Jake@It's fine. It's fine!@Tree Trunks
Finn@Are you sure? 'Cause she has zero adventurer training.@Tree Trunks
Jake@Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine, she'll be fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Maybe it is fine. Tree Trunks?@Tree Trunks
Jake@Where'd she go?@Tree Trunks
Finn@Tree Trunks!@Tree Trunks
Finn@We gotta find her, Jake! Tree Trunks!@Tree Trunks
Jake@Where are you, Tree Trunks?@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@And here's your teacup, and here's my teacup.@Tree Trunks
Finn & Jake@Tree Trunks!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@And here's your sandwich. Oops, you dropped it.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Tree Trunks, run!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Oh, hey, Finn.@Tree Trunks
Jake@Hiya!@Tree Trunks
Finn@Time to call your mamas, evil sign posts.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Patience, boys. There's enough tea for everyone.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Errr...@Tree Trunks
Finn@NO!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Oh, Finn. What a nice hug.@Tree Trunks
Finn@I'm not hugging you! I'm trying to save your life! There's too many!!@Tree Trunks
Jake@Finn?!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Oh, Finn. That tea party was crummier than a big old biscuit.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Errrr. Tree Trunks, I'm all jacked up because of you. Look at my jacked up face!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Are you mad at me?@Tree Trunks
Finn@No, I'm not mad. You're too super-cute for me to be mad at you, and you're a top notch adventurer. Now, let's go find and eat the heck out of that crystal gem apple together.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Dang it!@Tree Trunks
Jake@You go fight—I'll keep Tree Trunks out of trouble.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Awesome.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@J-Jake I think Finn is getting jacked up again.@Tree Trunks
Jake@Yeah, Finn can handle it. He's 12.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@I think I know a way to help him out.@Tree Trunks
Jake@Uhh, you should stay here, Tree Trunks.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@But I thought Finn told me that I was a top notch adventurer. And my adventurer instincts tell me to seduce that tentacle critter with my womanly charms and elephant prowess.@Tree Trunks
Jake@Uhh, no way.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Uh, what are you doing here, Tree Trunks?@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@I'm helping you by tempting this guy with my body.@Tree Trunks
Finn@It's not a guy, Tree Trunks! It's a Snake Armed Ruby Brain Beast!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Even brain beasts get lonely, Finn!@Tree Trunks
Finn@Jake! You were supposed to watch her!@Tree Trunks
Jake@She got passed me, man. I tried to stop her, but she overpowered me.@Tree Trunks
Finn@GET her out of here!@Tree Trunks
Jake@Huh?@Tree Trunks
Jake@Finn, kill it!@Tree Trunks
Finn@I can't find it's magic gem weak spot!@Tree Trunks
Finn@Oh, there it is.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@I did it! I helped! I'm the sexiest adventurer in the world!@Tree Trunks
Finn@Tree Trunks!! You're not an adventurer! You nearly got yourself killed again! Do you wanna die, Tree Trunks?! Is that what you think adventurers do?! Die and make all their friends feel terrible 'cause they couldn't save them?!@Tree Trunks
Jake@Whoa, man.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@I'm going home now.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Ugh... Tree Trunks. Tree Trunks!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Don't follow me. Oh, Finn... You shouldn't yell at cuties that just wanna help you. OH!@Tree Trunks
Finn@Man, I feel horrible. I was only yelling because I care about her safety.@Tree Trunks
Jake@That's what happens when you care too much, dude.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@OH!@Tree Trunks
Finn and Jake@Tree Trunks! Huh!@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@Finn, I found the crystal gem apple.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Woohoo!@Tree Trunks
Jake@You're the man, Tree Trunks!@Tree Trunks
Finn@Tree Trunks, I'm a huge butt guy for getting mad at you. I'm a huge fart. I was only upset because... I love you and I don't wanna see you get hurt.@Tree Trunks
Tree Trunks@That's precious, Finn, and I'll accept your apology if you let me kiss your cheek.@Tree Trunks
Finn@Uhhhh, I don't know, I--@Tree Trunks
Jake@Whoa! Let her kiss your cheek, man. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.@Tree Trunks
Crystal Guardian Jake@Whoa! Let her kiss your cheek, man. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.@Tree Trunks
Crystal Guardian Finn@Uhhhh, I don't know...@Tree Trunks
Finn@A crystal guardian! Tree Trunks, stay out of the monster battle this time. I don't want you getting hurt.@Tree Trunks

Princess Bubblegum@It's called the Enchiridion. It's a book meant only for heroes whose hearts are righteous.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Shmow-zow!@The Enchiridion!
Princess Bubblegum@The book lies at the top of Mount Cragdor, guarded by a manly minotaur. It's waiting for a truly righteous hero to claim it!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Do you think I've got the goods, Bubblegum? 'Cause I am in to this stuff!@The Enchiridion!
Princess Bubblegum@Yeah, I know. And yes, I do.@The Enchiridion!

Finn@Bye, Princess! You know what time it is, buddy?@The Enchiridion!
Jake@Aaaaadventure time?@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Yeah, man!@The Enchiridion!
Key-per@Greetings, young heroes to be. This mountain is called Cragdor. Its purpose is two-fold To protect the Enchiridion and to test the hearts of those who seek to possess it. Many noble challengers have entered the temple to pass the grueling trials that lie behind these walls, but no one has ever left here alive or dead! Only the truest most worthy hero can receive the heroes' Enchiridion and walk out these doors again! If it is you, friend, and I cannot say that I am certain, but you are verily welcome to try; However, first you must pass my riddle. My name is Key-per, and duly so, for I carry the key to this door, but all is not how it appears, you see. Or perhaps you do not see at all. Perhaps the key is in you, child, but you cannot use your brawn here. The door is magically sealed.@The Enchiridion!
Key-per@Oh ho! You've unlocked the riddle of the door. Brilliantly done, child! Please, reveal to me how you unraveled my clue.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@I just thought you'd look cute stuffed in that lock.@The Enchiridion!
Key-per@Oh, yes. That's how most people get in.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Bye!@The Enchiridion!
Key-per@You've passed the first trial, young heroes, but prepare yourselves! For there are many trials ahead of you, and each trial is more treacherous than the last.@The Enchiridion!
Jake@Enchiridion is... That way.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@What?! Dude! You can't smell the book from here!@The Enchiridion!
Jake@It's in the castle on top of the mountain. In a room. Wish you had one, huh?@The Enchiridion!
Finn@This way!@The Enchiridion!
Jake@What about the book?@The Enchiridion!
Finn@It can wait. Someone needs our help.@The Enchiridion!
Jake@Yo, Finn. Are you alright? Did you get brain damage?@The Enchiridion!
Finn@I'm fine! Keep going! We have to hurry!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@I gotcha.@The Enchiridion!
Red Gnome@Thank you for saving us. Now we can destroy this old lady!@The Enchiridion!
Old Lady@La la la-la!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@What?!@The Enchiridion!
Red Gnome@Every time you say "what" we'll destroy an old lady.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@What?!@The Enchiridion!
Red Gnome@Every time you say "no" we'll destroy an old lady.@The Enchiridion!

Red Gnome@Kill him!@The Enchiridion!
Jake@Get back in there!@The Enchiridion!
Jake@Hey, Finn. You okay?@The Enchiridion!
Finn@No way, dude. Those old ladies are destroyed because of me. I'm not righteous. I'm wrongteous. Stupidteous.@The Enchiridion!
Jake@Awww. Don't let those gnomes and their illusions get you down. They're just gnomes and illusions.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Illusions?@The Enchiridion!
Jake@Yeah, man. Think. What would regular, old, sweet ladies be doing wandering the hills of Mount Cragdor?@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Maybe they're lost?@The Enchiridion!
Jake@No way. This place is designed to mess you up. To mess with your head. None of this is real. It's all just trials to test your heroic attributes.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Hmmm... Hmmm!@The Enchiridion!
Jake@Now let's go get that book.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Yeah! You're the smartest dog I know, man.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Jake? Jaaaaaaaake!@The Enchiridion!
Ogre@You cannot pass!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Gimme back my friend!@The Enchiridion!
Ogre@No!@The Enchiridion!
Jake@It's ok, Finn! I can get out!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Let Jake go, or I'll... I'll kick your foot!@The Enchiridion!
Ogre@It is impossible for you to hurt me!@The Enchiridion!
Jake@Don't worry, dude! I found another way—oof!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Huh? I'm coming, buddy!@The Enchiridion!
Ogre@I think your dog finally fell into my stomach. Hey... Where'd you go?@The Enchiridion!
Finn@I got your wallet, man!@The Enchiridion!
Ogre@No! My big money! Give it back!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Give me back my friend!@The Enchiridion!
Ogre@But I killed him already!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Fine. I'll give you your dollar. Here's your dollaaaaaarrrrr!@The Enchiridion!
Ogre@Oof!@The Enchiridion!
Jake@Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa-oa!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Jake! You're okay!@The Enchiridion!
Jake@Stomachs are weird.@The Enchiridion!
Jake@Dude! You just flew us all the way to the top! Wait a minute. I can smell the book right through this door.@The Enchiridion!
Ogre@You're under arrest for stealing my dollar!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Just a minute, Jake.@The Enchiridion!
Ogre@Hey!@The Enchiridion!
Jake@You know what that was? That was righteous.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Thanks, Jake. Now sniff out that book for me.@The Enchiridion!
Jake@You got it!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Whoa!@The Enchiridion!
Dark Magician@Congratulations, Finn the human. You must be truly righteous to have made it this far.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Thank you.@The Enchiridion!
Dark Magician@Now! Enter my brain-world, and I will show you some aspect of yourself that you're not entirely aware of.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Where... am I?@The Enchiridion!
Dark Magician@For your final trial, slay the beast!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Why? Is it an evil beast?@The Enchiridion!
Dark Magician@Yeeeeessss. It's completely evil. Will you slay it?@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Shoot, yeah. I'll slay anything that's evil. That's my deal.@The Enchiridion!
Dark Magician@Yeeeeessss! You've done well, hero.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Thank you.@The Enchiridion!
Dark Magician@Now! As one last, last trial... Slay this ant!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Is it evil?@The Enchiridion!
Dark Magician@No! But it's not good either. It's, uh, neutral. Will you slay it?@The Enchiridion!
Finn@No!@The Enchiridion!
Dark Magician@If you want the heroes' Enchiridion, then slay this unaligned ant!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Never. Never. Never!@The Enchiridion!
Dark Magician@Uh oh.@The Enchiridion!
Key-per@Congratulations, Finn the human. Now you have truly reached...@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Never!@The Enchiridion!
Key-per@Ooh!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Oh, no! Mr. Key-per! I-I'm sorry. Why are you wearing that little devil costume?@The Enchiridion!
Key-per@These are my pajamas. I was getting ready for bed.@The Enchiridion!
Mannish Man@Finn... Jake... You made it!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Are you another trial?@The Enchiridion!
Mannish Man@Trial? Oh, no! I'm Mannish Man, the minotaur.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@The manly minotaur from Princess Bubblegum's story!@The Enchiridion!
Finn@So, can I check out the Enchiridion? Can I? Can I? Can I?@The Enchiridion!
Mannish Man@Yeah. Come on. Let's go check it out. Woohoo!@The Enchiridion!
Mannish Man@We've been watching you guys on our magical viewing globe. Take a seat guys, have some juice. There's grape and apple and the gatekeeper made spaghetti. And... Alright, Finn. Are you ready for this?@The Enchiridion!
Finn@The Enchiridion!@The Enchiridion!
Mannish Man@You deserve it, Finn.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Really?@The Enchiridion!
Mannish Man@Yeah, Finn. You're the goodest of heart and most righteous hero I've seen here. Tenderness, ingenuity, bravery, nard-kicking ability, and when you took that giant ogre's dollar... Oh, man! The Key-per nearly fainted!@The Enchiridion!
Key-per@It's true!@The Enchiridion!
Jake@Hey! Crack open that book and read something for fun's sake, alright?@The Enchiridion!
Finn@Oh, yeah. Whoa. How to Kiss Princesses?@The Enchiridion!
Jake@Whoa. What'd you just read?@The Enchiridion!
Princess Bubblegum@Yeah. What does it say, Finn? Mannish Man won't tell me.@The Enchiridion!
Mannish Man@Hey. Don't tell her, Finn.@The Enchiridion!
Finn@It doesn't say anything, Princess.@The Enchiridion!
Princess Bubblegum@Mannish man!@The Enchiridion!

Jake@W-whoa!@The Jiggler
Finn@What the... Shmow-zow! Look at that!@The Jiggler
Jake@That... is the most adorable thing I have ever seen. And he loves your baby song. Sing some more of it, dude.@The Jiggler

Jake@Keep it going, man!@The Jiggler
Finn@Baby! You lookin' so fine. You lookin' like you might... just start cryin'.@The Jiggler
Jake@Yeah!@The Jiggler
Finn@Dude! This guy... is a pal for life! It looks like he's got two jiggly bellies stuck together.@The Jiggler
Jake@I've got that on my back. I call it my butt.@The Jiggler
Jake@Whoa!@The Jiggler
Finn@He's the Jiggler.@The Jiggler
Finn@You are the best thing ever. Let's take the Jiggler back to the house and just stick him by our bed so we can wake up...@The Jiggler
Finn & Jake@Next to a little dancing guy every morning!@The Jiggler

Finn@Hey, pal. You ready to cut loose? Wake and shake, buddy. Let's do this thing!@The Jiggler
Jake@Slam-a-cow! That fool looks rumped.@The Jiggler
Finn@What do you mean?@The Jiggler
Jake@Well, look at him. He's all limp... and weird.@The Jiggler
Finn@Aww... I bet he just needs some breakfast after a night of extraordinary jiggling. Hey! Let's combine everything we can find in the kitchen... and have the Jiggler drink it! That'll wake him up! And then we can... Get doooowwwn!@The Jiggler
Jake@He doesn't want to drink that goop, man.@The Jiggler

Jake@You mean the grapes?@The Jiggler
Finn@Yeah. Whatever.@The Jiggler
Finn@Hey! I think he's diggin' it!@The Jiggler
Jake@That doesn't sound good.@The Jiggler
Finn@Uhh...@The Jiggler
Jake@Uh, you think we... think we fed the wrong hole?@The Jiggler
Finn@Nah. He just doesn't like purple whatevers. What we need to do is figure out what he does like to eat.@The Jiggler
Finn@Here, Jiggler. What kind of food do you like? Meat? Some banana? This looks like corn... I think. Uh... hot dog. Stanley the watermelon.@The Jiggler
Finn@Look! Jake! He likes it!@The Jiggler
Finn@Wow!@The Jiggler
Jake@No way!@The Jiggler
Finn@His favorite food... is drawings! Awesome!@The Jiggler
Jake@Holy fig, that's awesome! What food are you drawing now?@The Jiggler
Finn@I'm drawing a picture of you.@The Jiggler
Jake@Well, don't feed it me!@The Jiggler
Finn@Come on. Eat him up, Jiggler!@The Jiggler
Jake@No!@The Jiggler
Jake@Ahhh! Keep it away! Shoo! Shoo!@The Jiggler
Finn@Alright. Alright. I got it. Calm down... I'll eat it. Ahhhhh.@The Jiggler

Finn@Well... You gonna eat yourself, tough guy?@The Jiggler
Jake@Yes. If that is what must be done.@The Jiggler
Jake@I taste awesome.@The Jiggler
Finn@Ok. Alright. Now, let's get back to some jiggling!@The Jiggler
Jake@I'll get the tunes!@The Jiggler

Jake@Yeah, Jiggler. Go nuts! Go nuts like there's bugs on your butts!@The Jiggler
Jake@Whoa!@The Jiggler
Finn@Jiggler?@The Jiggler
Jake@What the heck? What's wrong with him?@The Jiggler
Finn@Uh... There's nothing wrong with him. We just gotta plug up his holes.@The Jiggler
Finn@See? That worked. Ready to jiggle again, little guy?@The Jiggler
Finn@Whoa!@The Jiggler
Jake@Oh, man...@The Jiggler
Finn@Quick! We gotta plug those holes!@The Jiggler
Finn@Jake, hurry!@The Jiggler
Jake@All I could find was your glass eye collection!@The Jiggler
Finn@What about your eyepatch collection?@The Jiggler
Jake@Aw, man. They're in mint condition.@The Jiggler
Finn@Jake!@The Jiggler
Jake@Alright! Coming!@The Jiggler
Jake@One... more... patch! Finished. Ugh. He looks terrible. Finn, I know you don't want to hear this, but I think we should cut our losses and bring this fella back to where we found him.@The Jiggler
Finn@We can't just abandon him. Look at him, Jake. He needs us now more than ever. Just need to take better care of you from now on, right little guy?@The Jiggler
Finn@Jiggler!@The Jiggler
Jake@Oh... Finn. Ok... Our pet exploded.@The Jiggler
Jake@Maybe we can... scrape him up! And... eyuhh...@The Jiggler
Finn@Oh, holy moly! Don't worry, Jiggler. We'll fix you.@The Jiggler
Finn@Let's gather him up, Jake. He's all over the place... even between the floorboards!@The Jiggler
Jake@And the cupboards!@The Jiggler
Finn@And the galoshes!@The Jiggler
Jake@I wonder... Where's his heinie?@The Jiggler
Jake@Found it! Come here, you!@The Jiggler
Jake@Hey!@The Jiggler
Finn@Come on. Let's put him back together.@The Jiggler
Jake@Ok.@The Jiggler
Finn@Squeeze real hard. He's slipping!@The Jiggler
Jake@Got him!@The Jiggler
Jake@Well, at least he's all in one piece.@The Jiggler
Jake@Sheesh. You think he's dead?@The Jiggler
Finn@No way! I won't let you die, guy! Not this time.@The Jiggler
Jake@Finn. Stop it, man. What are you doing?@The Jiggler
Finn@I'm kissing him! What do you think? It's all I could think to do.@The Jiggler
Jake@Just put him down.@The Jiggler
Finn@He's kissing colors with his dying breath.@The Jiggler
Jake@I think he's trying to tell us something. Finn, this looks like it could be his Mama Jiggler@The Jiggler
Finn@We took this child away from its mama, Jake. We're kidnappers and murderers! I just wanted to have fun and jiggle!@The Jiggler
Jake@Look... Chill out, ok? We can fix this. Check it out. His mom looks like she's out by Stanley's house... where we found the Jiggler. If we get him back to her, she'll be able to fix him up!@The Jiggler
Finn@Then there's no time to spare.@The Jiggler
Finn@Shhh. Just hold on a little longer, buddy.@The Jiggler
Jake@Did you hear that? Whistling!@The Jiggler
Finn@Perpendicular! It's the mama!@The Jiggler
Jake@Look! The little guy wants to go home!@The Jiggler
Finn@Well. This is it, buddy.@The Jiggler
Jake@Be well.@The Jiggler
Finn@Hey! Stop that!@The Jiggler
Finn@I don't understand. That crazy mama almost killed him.@The Jiggler
Jake@He feels cold.@The Jiggler
Finn@What are we supposed to do now, man? We can't bring him home, or he'll... or he'll...@The Jiggler
Finn@Dang it! Why doesn't she love him? I love him! You love him! It's not fair! Ahhhh!@The Jiggler
Jake@Finn, wait!@The Jiggler
Finn@Mama's supposed to love baby! She's supposed to love baby!@The Jiggler
Jake@Huh?@The Jiggler
Jake@Oh, man!@The Jiggler
Finn@It's yours, idiot!@The Jiggler
Finn@Don't you recognize your own baby?@The Jiggler
Jake@Finn! I figured it out, dude. It's the juice. The Jiggler needs to smell like its mama's juice. That's how wild animals know what’s going on... and this guy right here is all drained out. We gotta toss it in the soup, brother.@The Jiggler
Finn@Alright. Ok. I loved you, baby. I hope you know that.@The Jiggler
Finn@Word to your motheeeerrrrr!@The Jiggler
Finn & Jake@Awww...@The Jiggler
Finn@I'll never kidnap again.@The Jiggler
Jake@You said it! That was a nightmare.@The Jiggler
Finn@Hey, fart-face!!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ice King@Huh?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Unhand Princess Bubblegum!!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ice King@Foolish interlopers! Zah!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Whoa! Ah!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ice King@Ee hee hee hee—OOH! MY EYESIGHT!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@Huh? Hee hee hee!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Hey, Ice King! I bet you'll never kiss the princess!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ice King@I will kiss her! I will! Hold still. Mwah!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@You just kissed Jake's butt!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ice King@What?! EEEEGH!! The hour is yours, but the day shall be mine! Just like you, Princess—MINE!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@What a patoot. Thanks for saving the day yet again, boys.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@You're welcome, Princess. Uh...@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@I'm gonna throw you two a party. Meet at the Candy Kingdom—TONIGHT!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@That paper crane for Princess Bubblegum?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@I just thought I'd bring 'er a gift... in return for throwing us this party.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Heh. I bet you wish you were my butt.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@What?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@I bet you wish you were my butt, because then the princess would... No, wait... I bet you wish you were the Ice King and the princess was my butt!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@What?!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Hmm... OH! I bet you wish Bubblegum would kiss you, too! Like the Ice King and my butt! Hahahaha!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@That's ridiculous! Huh? Uggghhh!! What's so funny?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Peppermint Butler@Hey, everybody. Finn and Jake are here.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Who's ready to party?!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@What's everyone laughing at?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Wildberry Princess@Shh!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Stand back, everyone. This style of massage is called, "Best Friend Massage."@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, my gosh...@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Because it can only be done for friends. It is completely consensual.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, holy cow...@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Relax yourself now, Lumpy Space Princess... YAH!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh! I feel so great!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Who is that guy?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Hahaaa!@Ricardio the Heart Guy

Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, my gosh! PB, ya gotta check out this super cute guy. You're gonna love 'im.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Uhhh...@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Lumpy Space Princess@This is... Oh. Oh, my gosh. I don't even know your name.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Ricardio. Ricardio at your service. I've been waiting all evening to meet you, Princess. Mwah! I've heard you appreciate ancient technology. Have you ever used the balbaflonic laser to align the hybernotalist rift in the bubaflon plasmodial formation?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@Whoa! No, I haven't! Wanna continue this conversation on the dance floor?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@It would be my pleasure, Princess.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Why didn't the princess invite me to dance?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@If you wanna dance, just go dance!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@But now she's dancing with him! Ah... I feel... weird!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Huh, it sounds like you're dealing with some new emotions you don't understand... like jealousy.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@BLAAAARGH!!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Look, man, just go out there and get down!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@—transmordial layers completely independent of the babylons. Eh?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@Wow! That would mean that the babylons would fluctuate with the piranha-nanosphere!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Correct!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Agh! They're talkin' about science, man! I can't compete with that!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Do the Science Dance! Remember it? It was sorta like this. Wah unh we ah eeh...@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@You think that'll work?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Yeah! Probably. Do it, man! You're a pro!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Science Dance! Science Dance!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@—lower proximities to—@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Science Dance! Hey, eh, Princess! You wanna spend some time with me?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Excuse me, Princess. You must excuse me.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, uh... Alright! Finn, what the cabbage? I was learning about Zanoits!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Oh... I'm... into Zanoits! Th-They're the best!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@Zanoits kill hundreds of thousands of Plantoids a year.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Oh, no, not the Plantoids!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@Plantoids produce mellotoxin! Mellotoxin kills Zanoits!!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@...So are Zanoits... good things?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@You're totally jealous of Ricardio.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@No, I'm not. I just don't like the way he talks to you. It makes me feel weird.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@That's jealousy, hun.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@I'm not jealous! I'M WEIRD!!!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Woof! Man... This is goin' bad. Hey, Finn. You gotta come help me slay these peanut monsters at the bar. It can't wait. Wow, man, what happened out there?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Agh... I don't know! I was tryin' to warn 'er, but she twisted my words around and—@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Yeah. Ladies are twisty, man. Bubblegum's super smart, too.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@I know! And I can't shake this weird feeling about Ricardio. I think he's... a villain.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Why? Is it because his face is so foldy and dramatic?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@No! I can just feel it in my gut! He's up to something sinister!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Maybe what you feel is romantic rivalry.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@I'll prove he's a villain!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@How?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Stakeout.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Here he comes! They're talking!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Lemme see. I can read their lips. "Hey, shorty, you should pick your boogers and then fart!" "You look kind of like a big pink baguette!"@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Get serious, Jake!! This is life and death!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Is it? Don't get me wrong. I'm all about stakeouts and spying on this guy, but what if he's not a villain? What if he just looks wicked? Some people look wicked but are super nice.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@I gotta trust my gut!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Hmm.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@He's on the move! Let's roll! I see 'im. He's holding rope and going into the trash. He's smashing bottles—and pretending to stab someone!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@So... he's recycling... or what?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@I think your gut's a little naive, Jake. Holy moly! He's... he's with the Ice King! They're shouting something! Ricardio is tossing him in the dumpster and running away!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@So I was right! He is a good guy who's just cursed to look suspicious! You and me, gut! Together forever! Solvin' crimes and makin' up rhymes!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@No way. This proves he's a super-villain! More powerful than lesser villains like the Ice King!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Then it's settled! We're gonna confront Ricardio face-to-face and prove he's evil!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Or good!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Oof!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@So what're you doin', Ricardio? Are you evil?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Or nice with an evil face?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@That's none of your business.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@The safety of Princess Bubblegum is my business!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Yeah, we just wanna know if you're evil or not.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Oh, yeah?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn & Jake@Yeah.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Oh, yeah?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Yeah. Yes!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@You stay away from Princess Bubblegum with all that stuff!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Now that my plan is nearly complete, there is no way you could stop me.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@I could stop you if I wanted!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Oh, yeah?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Yeah!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Oh, yeah??@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@YEEEAAAH!!!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@What's going on here?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Princess?!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@Ricardio?!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Yes... I'm alright, Princess.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@Finn... why'd you do it?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@He was gonna hurt you with those ropes and bottles!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@These were for our balbaflonic laser.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@It's not all his fault, Princess. I might've looked a little threatening.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@Finn... you shouldn't punch brainiacs. You know how fragile they are! You gotta stop this jealous business.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@But...@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@C'mon, Ricardio. I'll patch you up and give you candy.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@She hates me now. I was totally wrong about Ricardio.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ice King@No, Finn! You were not wrong. He is evil!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Ice King! What do you know about this? Tell me or I'll do something!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Hold up, Finn! The Ice King looks sorta damaged!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@I don't care! I only care about Ricardio!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ice King@But my enervated condition has everything to do with him. I was trying to cast a spell that would give me total control of Princess Bubblegum's heart! ...But I messed it all up... and lost control of mine. He planned to rip out Princess Bubblegum's heart... to make it his bride. Without my heart, I grew weak. But I made my way to the Candy Kingdom to look for him. In an alleyway, I begged him to return to me and leave the princess alone. But he threw me in the dumpster and left me for dead. Stop Ricardio!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Agh! Come on, Jake! Gotta save the princess!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@Princess Bubblegum!!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Princess!!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@Finn!! Jake!!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@You were right all along, Finn! Now I'm going to cut out Princess Bubblegum's heart and make out with it!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Not if I can help it!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@One step closer and I'll remove her heart!!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Princess Bubblegum@Finn! I feel like a big idiot for doubting you! He was just so engaging! ...But his knowledge on plantoids is actually pretty weak.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Shut your mouth up, Princess! I'm gonna smooch that heart!! It will be my bride!!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Why don't you marry someone your own size?! Like my foot?!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Huh?!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@And my fist?!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ice King@Stop! Stop it! That's my heart, you piece of—@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Finn@Ice King. Should we... let 'im take his heart back? He is... villainous...@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Jake@I don't wanna watch an old man die on Princess Bubblegum's carpet, man.@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ice King@Oh, yeah...@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Wait! Wait! No!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ice King@Come to daddy...@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Noooooooooo!@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ice King@Yeah, there you go... Like that? Huh?@Ricardio the Heart Guy
Ricardio@Seeee you guys laterrrr...@Ricardio the Heart Guy

Finn@No wait fellas! The mountain doesn't like roughhousing.@Memories of Boom Boom Mountain
Head Marauder@Well we don’t like not roughhousing! Ya see the problem here?@Memories of Boom Boom Mountain
Finn@Well. Well what if we rotate the entire mountain 180 degrees around, so the mountain’s facing the other direction. That way, you guys can keep roughhousing and the mountain doesn't have to watch it!@Memories of Boom Boom Mountain
Head Marauder@Sounds fine with me!@Memories of Boom Boom Mountain
Finn@What do ya say mountain!@Memories of Boom Boom Mountain
Mountain Man@That’s okay. Only if you guys promise to stay healthy and not roughhouse after you rotate me.@Memories of Boom Boom Mountain

Jake@Whoa, dude. Hold on. So this guy wants this and that guy wants that, but man. What do you want?@Memories of Boom Boom Mountain
Joshua@Want do you want baby? Why are you crying? Margaret, this baby won’t tell me what’s wrong with it, and it’s stuck to a leaf, and it stinks.@Memories of Boom Boom Mountain
Margaret@Give it here Joshua. This baby needs love and kisses to be happy. There. See? Now it’s happy.@Memories of Boom Boom Mountain
Joshua@You just kissed a boom boom baby. So don’t expect any more sugar from me, sweetheart until we wash your dirty dirty face.@Memories of Boom Boom Mountain

Finn@Hey, Jake.@Wizard
Jake@Yeah?@Wizard
Finn@You ever wonder what a demon's heart looks like?@Wizard
Jake@Of course, dude.@Wizard
Finn@You ever wonder what a demon's heart tastes like?@Wizard
Reaper@Hey, kid... You want some magic powers...? Magic powers for absolutely free...@Wizard
Finn@Heck yeah!@Wizard
Jake@Wait! Let's not be too rash! Just look at this guy! Check out the sunken, lifeless eyes... The foul stench of decay... You know what that means?@Wizard
Finn@Means he's evil, I guess.@Wizard
Jake@Well, evil, sure... but mostly, he's unattractive, and unattractive people are desperate. You should haggle with him!@Wizard
Finn@Hey! I want more than just free powers! What else ya got?!@Wizard
Reaper@Alright... Free magical powers and... Eh! And this keychain.@Wizard
Finn@OH! OH! OH!@Wizard
Jake@Play it cool, Finn.@Wizard
Finn@Right. I begrudgingly accept your offer.@Wizard
Reaper@Yes... Then the deal is struck! WAHAHAHAHAHA! You can pick up your powers right through that door. This way...@Wizard
Finn@This place looks magical. You think this is where we get the powers?@Wizard
Host@Yes, I do. Free powers for all. Want some?@Wizard
Finn@Yeah! Are you the guy handing 'em out?@Wizard
Host@You seek Bufo, the wizard!@Wizard
Finn@So, where's that guy?@Wizard
Host@He is here, of course.@Wizard
Finn@Uh...@Wizard
Jake@He's here... but he's not you.@Wizard
Host@That's right.@Wizard
Jake@We should beat 'im up until he starts makin' sense!@Wizard
Bufo@We are Bufo!@Wizard
Finn@Ohhhh...@Wizard
Bufo@So... you wish to be inducted into the ancient order of— Dang it, Leonard!! If we don't talk at the same time, nobody can understand us!@Wizard
Tadpole@Sorry... geez...@Wizard
Bufo@Ahem... So... You want free wizard powers... Powers like... these!@Wizard
Finn & Jake@Hahaha! Yeah! We want 'em! Give us the stuff!@Wizard
Jake@Oh, boy!@Wizard
Finn@Yes, we do! Can't wait!@Wizard
Bufo@Then follow....@Wizard
Finn@Whoo-hoo!@Wizard
Jake@Whoo!@Wizard
Bufo@Behold the Grand Hall of Wizardry! This is where young potentials train to become Ultimate Wizards! Most are not ready for the responsibility that comes with it.@Wizard
Finn@I'm responsible, dude!@Wizard
Jake@Yeah! So am I!@Wizard
Finn@That's a lie!@Wizard
Jake@It is a lie... and I take full responsibility for it!@Wizard
Bufo@Yes, yes... very responsible. Now I bestow upon you these wizard cloaks!@Wizard
Finn & Jake@Whoa!@Wizard
Finn@Hey! This is a dress!@Wizard
Jake@Yeah! And I am into it! It's, like, gossamer!@Wizard
Finn@This way I won't be embarrassed!@Wizard
Bufo@Fine, fine. Now for every power that you accrue, you shall receive a star badge like these. This final star betokens the rank of Ultimate Wizard!@Wizard
Finn@Mark me, Jake. I shall have that final star! Where do we start?!@Wizard
Bufo@Level 1—Dustomancy.@Wizard
Finn@Yeah! Dustomancy! Whatever that is! Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme!@Wizard
Bufo@To receive this power, you must first... eat these brooms.@Wizard
Finn@Alright. Ah, wait! This is gross!! Man, I can't eat this!@Wizard
Jake@Yeah, you can! Do what I do! RAAAAWR!! Oops. Ah, there we go.@Wizard
Finn@Whoooaaa! You got a star!@Wizard
Jake@Haha! Observe my magics!@Wizard
Finn@Wait, Jake! Don't use 'em until I finish my broom! Last... bite...@Wizard
Jake@Dude, you got your star, too!@Wizard
Finn@WE'RE DUSTOMANCERS! Nothing happened! This is a total ripoff!! Bufo! You tricked us! Stupid power doesn't even work!!@Wizard
Bufo@Calm yourself, boy. You are acting hysterical. Do you not see that you are using Dustomancy? Behold...@Wizard
Finn@I'm doing this? So... I have—@Wizard
Bufo@Yes. Mastery over all dust motes. You can also read their emotions. For instance, this mote is very unhappy in his marriage.@Wizard
Jake@Well, that's... sorta cool.@Wizard
Finn@"Sorta" cool?!? THIS IS RADICAL!@Wizard
Jake@Whoo, yeah! Force that enthusiasm!@Wizard
Bufo@Are you ready for more magic?@Wizard
Finn@We get more?!@Wizard
Bufo@So much more... like Level 2... the power of... Shadowcery! You can't see through those, right?@Wizard
Finn@Nope... Not at all.@Wizard
Bufo@To gain provenance over the shadows, place your hands into this bowl!@Wizard
Jake@What bowl?@Wizard
Bufo@No! Cover your eyes!@Wizard
Jake@Mmmm, fine...@Wizard
Bufo@Thrust your hands into this bowl... of eyeballs.@Wizard
Finn@Eyeballs?!@Wizard
Jake@Dude, it's okay. They're just peeled grapes.@Wizard
Bufo@No! They're eyeballs... Well done. You have groped the eyeballs fearlessly.@Wizard
Finn@Another star! Yeah! Shadowcery... Onward, my shadow steed! Huh?@Wizard
Shadow Horse@No touchies.@Wizard
Finn@Wizard powers are so cool... I want ALL THE STAR BADGES!!!@Wizard
Bufo@Excellent.@Wizard
Bufo@Well done.@Wizard
Finn@All we're missing now is the big star! You ready to complete the set, man?@Wizard
Jake@Nah, I'm good.@Wizard
Finn@WHAT?! How can you stop now??@Wizard
Jake@Eh... I've got everything I need. A limitless supply of mayonnaise, this captivating new hairstyle... and I just learned the best spell of all!@Wizard
Finn@What's that?@Wizard
Jake@Sleep.@Wizard
Finn@Aw... What a lame-o. Bufo! I'm ready to get that big star!@Wizard
Bufo@To tell true, the last power is not free.@Wizard
Finn@Wha?? You can't do this to me, man! I've got no money!@Wizard
Bufo@No, no cash. For the final star, you must take the pledge of ultimate responsibility.@Wizard
Finn@Okay. I'll take that pledge.@Wizard
Bufo@Are you sure? Perhaps you are not sufficiently familiar with—@Wizard
Finn@I'm ready!@Wizard
Bufo@Well, there may be ramifications that you cannot—@Wizard
Finn@Just let me take that pledge, man!@Wizard
Bufo@My word, I've never met someone so irresponsibly responsible. Very well, then. You must... grasp my hand.@Wizard
Finn@That's it? Easy! Huh? My big star!! Yes!! Wha-hoo! Yeah!! Wait, where am I?@Wizard
Bufo@Direct your attention to the scale-model orb.@Wizard
Finn@Huh? Is that an asteroid heading for this very temple?@Wizard
Bufo@Yes. It's been heading for this temple for 847 years. Only the magic of the ultimate wizards keeps it from getting any closer. Quickly, add your power to that of the orb.@Wizard
Finn@Oh, okay. Whoa! I got it! Now what?@Wizard
Bufo@Now I release the elder Jeremy from his pledge. Razzamafoo!@Wizard
Bufo@And you take his place... for the rest of your natural life.@Wizard
Finn@Awesome. ... Wait, what?!@Wizard
Bufo@This is what you signed up for when you took the pledge of ultimate responsibility.@Wizard
Finn@This is what all the wizard training was about?! You tricked me!@Wizard
Old Wizard@Young wizard! The asteroid approaches!@Wizard
Finn@Oh, yeah. Sorry.@Wizard
Bufo@I tricked you, of course... but would anyone really volunteer to do this? I'm out.@Wizard
Finn@Aw, man, this sucks. Old people! There's gotta be a better way!@Wizard
Old Wizard@Nope... This is how the ancient ones wanted it.@Wizard
Finn@Yeah? I've got a younger idea!@Wizard
Old Wizard@You fool! Your newfangled thinking will get us all killed!@Wizard
Finn@Youth culture forever! Whoa.@Wizard
Bufo@Hey! Have you gone crazy?! Get back in the bouncy harness!@Wizard
Finn@Sleep!@Wizard
Bufo@You are—! Uhh...@Wizard
Finn@Ultimate Wizardry, activate! ...Uh... Hm. Maybe my footing's off? There you go! I cast... Dragon Eyes! Tiger Claw! Vorpal Hand! Blazing Feet! Beauteous Wings! And finally... every other power I didn't mention by naaaame! With all my magics combined, I'm powerful enough to move the entire village out of the asteroid's path! I need some help! Jake!! Awaken!!@Wizard
Jake@Reflect.@Wizard
Rock@Hey, I'm alive! What's that up there? AH! OH, NO!@Wizard
Finn@Hah... My stupid young idea will be responsible for hundreds of deaths!@Wizard
Old Wizard@It sure will!@Wizard
Finn@Huh? Old wizards! You ditched your responsibilities to help me!@Wizard
Old Wizard@What? No! We left so we wouldn't be killed by that asteroid!@Wizard
Finn@Oh, okay, um, since you're here already, could you lend me a hand??@Wizard
Jake@Huh??@Wizard
Finn@Whoo-hoo! Nice job! Thanks to us, the village is saved. And we reclaimed a few of your twilight years!@Wizard
Bufo@Don't forget to thank me. For this was my plan for all of these 847 years.@Wizard
Finn@No way! Your plan was to dupe a succession of rubes into keeping the asteroid at bay!@Wizard
Bufo@Perhaps you're right. No more giving out free powers. I hereby renounce all magic. My life is oveeeeeer!@Wizard
Finn@Chill, man. You don't have to quit your job.@Wizard
Bufo@I don't?@Wizard
Finn@Nah. Just don't take credit for ideas that aren't yours.@Wizard
Bufo@Oh... okay... Good idea... Glad I thought of it...@Wizard
Reaper@Hey, naked kid. you want some free... Demon heart?!@Wizard
Finn@Aw, ha ha ha haw, yeah!@Wizard
Jake@Full circle!!@Wizard
Jake@And as it waded through the carnage that it had wrought, the vampire smashed their skulls just for the fun of it!@Evicted!
Finn@No way!@Evicted!
Jake@Yes way, it did. And also the vampire hunched over its victims and breathed their vaporized blood mist.@Evicted!
Finn@Ah, jeez! Jake, is this stuff you're saying true? Or are you just trying to mess me up? You have to be honest.@Evicted!
Jake@Oh, it's true, man. I heard it through a reliable source.@Evicted!
Finn@Reliable? Rats!@Evicted!
Jake@Yeah. Some say it haunted this very tree!@Evicted!
Finn@This tree?!@Evicted!
Jake@Good niiiight...@Evicted!
Finn@Jake?@Evicted!
Finn@You're full of it, Jake!@Evicted!
Finn@Errr... NO WORMS ON THE BED!@Evicted!
Finn@Huh?@Evicted!
Finn@AAAAAH!!!@Evicted!
Finn@Jake! Jake! I saw someone outside the window! It must be the vampire, and I think we're unprepared, so I--@Evicted!
Jake@Relax, buddy. I made that story up. I was just trying to scare you.@Evicted!
Finn@But you said you heard it from a reliable source!@Evicted!
Jake@Ha ha! I made that up, too. I was trying to scare you, and it worked!@Evicted!
Finn@No one's outside.@Evicted!
Jake@Whew!@Evicted!
Finn@It was just the wind, scaredy-cat.@Evicted!
Jake@I wasn't scared, I was singing. I was singing my scream song. Ahh! Ahh! AAaah-uh-aah!@Evicted!
Finn@You're a total wuss, man.@Evicted!
Marceline@Hey, guys. What's up? I'm Marceline the Vampire Queen.@Evicted!
Finn@Are you gonna smash my skull and breathe my blood mist?!@Evicted!
Jake@Don't suck our blood!@Evicted!
Marceline@Calm down, weenies. I'm not gonna do that.@Evicted!
Finn@Soooo, you don't suck blood?@Evicted!
Marceline@Sometimes, I do. But it's not the blood that I like. It's the color. I eat shades of red.@Evicted!
Marceline@Ugh, I am exhausted. I've been traveling all over the Land of Ooo. And I've seen some stuff that would really make you say "like what?"@Evicted!
Finn@Like what?@Evicted!
Marceline@I encountered a school of goldfish beasts.@Evicted!
Marceline@And I fooled around in the Fire Kingdom.@Evicted!
Finn@OOO!@Evicted!
Marceline@Oh, and check these out.@Evicted!
Finn@Nuts?@Evicted!
Marceline@Oh, these aren't ordinary nuts.@Evicted!
Finn@You're wonderful.@Evicted!
Jake@Um, yeah. Thank you for not sucking our blood.@Evicted!
Marceline@You guys seem cool, too, but as you can imagine, I'm really tired, so you two should probably get going.@Evicted!
Finn@What?@Evicted!
Marceline@Look. "M" for "Marceline."@Evicted!
Jake@Aw, man.@Evicted!
Marceline@I carved in this tree years ago. Way before you two rascals started squatting here.@Evicted!
Marceline@But seriously guys, thanks for keeping the place warm for me, I mean really great!@Evicted!
Marceline@Good night!@Evicted!
Jake@Come on, Finn. Let's get out of here.@Evicted!
Finn@She can't kick us out of our house!@Evicted!
Jake@Finn!@Evicted!
Finn@Get down here, lady, and fight me!@Evicted!
Jake@She's a vampire, dude!@Evicted!
Finn@I'm gonna kill her.@Evicted!
Jake@Dude, if half the stories I've heard, and/or made up are true, vampires will kill you. There's no question!@Evicted!
Finn@But, what about our home?@Evicted!
Jake@A VAMPIRE TOOK IT! Aw, we should go house-hunting. Bag us a new house.@Evicted!
Finn@But I like our home.@Evicted!
Jake@Finn, house-hunting is wild! You've got to try it.@Evicted!
Finn@Really?@Evicted!
Jake@Yeah, man! It is so nuts!@Evicted!
Finn@You always know what to say.@Evicted!
Jake@Bla-bla-bla-ble-ble-bla-bloo-bloop!@Evicted!
Finn@Okay. I'm convinced. Let's roll!@Evicted!
Jake@Sweet, things are gonna start going our way. Hey, look, see? What'd I tell ya?@Evicted!
Finn@This is weak! I don't even like any of these places. I wanna go home.@Evicted!
Jake@Finn, let me tell you a little something about what home really means. La, la, la... Home isn't a place, let me give you a clue... Home is anywhere, where people care about you...@Evicted!
Finn@I don't wanna hear a lecture, dude! I just wanna go home...@Evicted!
Jake@But, home is where your heart is, Finn! And where is your heart, Finn? Well, it's right here inside you when I'm sitting here beside you! With your lucky stars to guide you from above.@Evicted!
Finn@Yeah, I guess I'd rather be out here, wrapped in your ear, than be in some awesome house all by my... souse.@Evicted!
Jake@I'd rather be dancing with some babes!@Evicted!
Finn@Shut up, dude!@Evicted!
Jake@Ew... Gross. This place looks gross!@Evicted!
Finn@And abandoned.@Evicted!
Finn@Whoa, bro... Wanna just live in here?@Evicted!

Jake@We're home as long as we're together, bla-bla-bleep-bla-bloop, remember!?@Evicted!
Finn@Oh, yeah. Okay, Marceline, I'm gonna let you keep this cave, but only because Jake is my home, and he's way better than all your homes combined!@Evicted!
Marceline@Ya know, you're right. I guess I'll take him too!@Evicted!
Finn@What!?@Evicted!
Marceline@I'll bite him a little, maybe turn him into a zombie.@Evicted!
Jake@Nooo!@Evicted!
Finn@Let go of Jake!@Evicted!
Marceline@Make me.@Evicted!
Finn@You okay, pal?@Evicted!
Marceline@No one... makes me... let go... of Jake!@Evicted!

Marceline@'Cuz that was fun! I haven't fought like that in years! Thanks, Finn.@Evicted!
Jake@Finn!@Evicted!
Finn@Aren't you dead?@Evicted!
Jake@Naaah, before she bit me I used my powers to shrink all my guts and blood over my thumb, see?@Evicted!
Marceline@You two are pretty hardcore. I can appreciate that.@Evicted!

Penny@I have an idea! My mom used to tell me that there's a King of Thieves who lives in the center of the city, and everything that gets stolen from little girls ends up at his tower. Maybe we'd find my basket in his treasure chest!@City of Thieves
Finn@That's a great idea, Penny!@City of Thieves
Penny@There's one thing, though. The tower that he lives in is surrounded by a magical barrier. Which magically keeps thieves out.@City of Thieves
Finn@Have you forgotten?! We three ain't thieves! We're pure! Right, Jake? Jake?@City of Thieves
Jake@Just gotta steal these boots...@City of Thieves
Finn@Jake!@City of Thieves
Jake@Huh?@City of Thieves
Baskets & Boots owner@Hey! Go away!@City of Thieves
Finn@What are you doin', man?@City of Thieves
Jake@It's the city, it's getting to me. Help me, Finn!@City of Thieves
Finn@I'm here for ya buddy.@City of Thieves
Jake@Thank you Finn, thank you.@City of Thieves
Finn@Nooo! I won't let you become a thief!@City of Thieves
Finn@Bells. That way, I'll hear you if you try to steal again.@City of Thieves
Jake@Oh. Hmm.@City of Thieves
Penny@The King of Thieves' tower is right up here.@City of Thieves
Finn@Woah. You read to pass through, Penny?@City of Thieves
Penny@I'm too afraid! Is it okay if I wait out here?@City of Thieves
Finn@Sure. C'mon, let's go, Jake!@City of Thieves
Jake@Comin'!@City of Thieves
Finn@Jake, where'd you get those boots?@City of Thieves
Jake@Huh, what? What boots? Oh, no! I stole! The city! It took advantage of me!@City of Thieves
Finn@Jake, you're a thief now! You won't be able to get in anymore!@City of Thieves
Jake@Yes, I can. Oh.@City of Thieves
Finn@It's up to me, now.@City of Thieves
Penny@Legend says you'll find the loot in the King of Thieves' chest. Good luck, Finn! Oh, yeah, and that high window is the only entrance.@City of Thieves
Finn@Hmm. Alright, wish me luck!@City of Thieves
Jake@She already did, man.@City of Thieves
Finn@Oh, yeah. Right. Great, now I gotta climb down?! Huh? The King of Thieves! Sorry to trespass, I just... Uh, hello? The chest! In it's in his chest! Thanks!@City of Thieves
Jake@You see, if you have too much earwax, you won't be able to hear anymore.@City of Thieves
Finn@I got it, guys!@City of Thieves
Penny@The chest! Gimme that!@City of Thieves
Finn@Huh?@City of Thieves
Jake@Woah, woah, woah. Easy, kid.@City of Thieves
Finn@What?! Is you basket under all that gold?@City of Thieves
Penny@Of course it's not! I set you up to steal this chest of gold! I couldn't get past the barrier 'cause I'm a thief!@City of Thieves
Finn@But you're just a cute little girl!@City of Thieves
Penny@And, I'm a thief!@City of Thieves
Finn@Well, if this isn't yours, I'm gonna return it right now! Huh? Why can't I...?@City of Thieves
Penny@Because you stole something in the city! Now you're a thief!@City of Thieves
Finn@No! No!!! What have I done?! What have I become?!@City of Thieves
Penny@You've become a thief, stupid!@City of Thieves
Finn@My hands. They're all dirty. Covered in the dust of a criminal act! I'm a thief!@City of Thieves
Hag@Oh, what did I tell you, boy? This city will get you, no matter how pure you think you are! I was right.@City of Thieves
Jake@Hey, that's enough from you, Hag! Finn?@City of Thieves
Finn@Don't touch me! I'm impure, man! Unfit to be a hero! Unfit to be your friend.@City of Thieves
Jake@Come on, Finn, keep it together!@City of Thieves
Finn@No, Jake. This is a one-way path, down a jacked-up road. And I gotta walk it... alone.@City of Thieves
Jake@I'm not gonna leave you alone in the city. You're my buddy. Besides, I stole these boots. These super-big style boots. So I'm just as dirty as you are, Finn. We gotta walk this filthy path together!@City of Thieves
Finn@Then we shall embrace the darkness of this wicked city and use the methods of the criminal to seek vengeance on Penny.@City of Thieves
Jake@Cowabunga!@City of Thieves
Finn@Cowabunga, indeed.@City of Thieves
Penny@Mmm. Yes. Yeah. Wha? Is someone there?! @City of Thieves
Finn@It's me, Penny. The hero whose purity you stole! And I'm here to enact my revenge upon you!@City of Thieves
Jake@Hi, Penny.@City of Thieves
Penny@Finn, please don't punch my lights out! I'm just a poor, homeless baby girl.@City of Thieves
Finn@I trusted you, Penny. You made me steal. And you took my purity. You ruined me!@City of Thieves
Penny@I'm sorry, Finn. Let me give you some uh, gems, or some gold, or uh, have some knife in your neck!@City of Thieves
Jake@Watch out, Finn!@City of Thieves
Finn@Thanks, dude.@City of Thieves
Jake@Yeah, dude.@City of Thieves
Penny@You may have soiled my purity, but I think you can still come out clean. C'mon, Jake!@City of Thieves
Penny@No! No!@City of Thieves
Jake@Nice work, dude.@City of Thieves
Finn@She's purified!@City of Thieves
Penny@I feel...clean! Like all the filth of the city and wrongdoings are gone! Thank you F and J! I haven't felt like this since I was young!@City of Thieves
Finn@You're welcome.@City of Thieves
Jake@Woah, dude! The soap got on us, too!@City of Thieves
Finn@We're clean!@City of Thieves
Finn and Jake@Yes!@City of Thieves
Finn@This good deed we did has purified us once again. We're virgin islands!@City of Thieves
Penny@Finn, thanks for the second chance to live a pure life.@City of Thieves
Finn@And you know what that means, Penny. No more stealing!@City of Thieves
Penny@Never again.@City of Thieves
Finn@Well, I think it's time for us to get the math out of here.@City of Thieves
Penny@I'm going to miss you, Finn!@City of Thieves
Finn@I'll miss you, too.@City of Thieves
Penny@G'bye!@City of Thieves
Jake@Woah, dude. Why are you naked?@City of Thieves
Finn@Penny!@City of Thieves
Jake@Dude... how long are we gonna follow this frog?@The Witch's Garden
Finn@I just wanna see 'im put on that crown.@The Witch's Garden
Finn & Jake@Wooow!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@It looks cool in there!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Too bad we don't have the key to this.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@What're you talkin' about? I got two keys right here!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Whoo-hoo!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Wow! Look at this place!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Jake. Are these donuts?@The Witch's Garden
Jake@They look like donuts.@The Witch's Garden
Finn@But maybe they're poisonous donuts! Yeah! Sniff it, Jake! Suck up those toxins!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Wait a second... I don't know what poison smells like.@The Witch's Garden
Witch@Hey! Razzamafoo!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Hey!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@What gives?!@The Witch's Garden
Witch@You ate one of my donuts!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@No, I didn't. I just sniffed it.@The Witch's Garden
Witch@RAAAAAGH!! You're lying! The stink of magic dog lips is everywhere!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Holy slug, lady! Calm down!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Listen, Mrs. Witch.@The Witch's Garden
Witch@I never married!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Well, I never ate your donuts.@The Witch's Garden
Witch@You... you're eating one right now!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@No, I'm not! Whoa-hoa! Hm... That's weird... I don't even remember grabbing this. My subconscious must be hungry, huh? Huh... whatever.@The Witch's Garden
Witch@MAGICUS NOMORICUS!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Uh-oh.@The Witch's Garden
Finn@AAH! Dude, are you okay?@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Yeah... I think so. Just a little chilly. WHOA!@The Witch's Garden
Witch@Ahahahahahehehe!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@What did she do to you?@The Witch's Garden
Witch@I stripped him of his magical powers!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@For stealing one of your billions of donuts?!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Yeah, it's not like I killed your husband or somethin'.@The Witch's Garden
Witch@I AM NOT MARRIED!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@The point is you overreacted.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@And what gives? I used to have like eight more of these things.@The Witch's Garden
Witch@The only way I'll give back your powers is if you admit your error and say you're sorry and mean it! ...'Cause I can tell the difference.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Well, you can forget it because you're the one who's wrong! ...Right?@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Total support, dude.@The Witch's Garden
Witch@RRRRAAAARRGH!! Go-backicus-from-whence-you-came-icus!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Aw, now you're just makin' these up!@The Witch's Garden
Witch@Are you alright, my... my donut pretties? Heh heh... Wait a second. YOU'RE A BAGEL! LIARS! LIARS EVERYWHERE! @The Witch's Garden
Finn@There's gotta be a way to get your powers back! Where'd they come from, anyway? Were you born with them? Or... did you have a freak industrial accident?!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Ha. That takes me back. Let me just... remember. I see a memory. When I was just a pupster... I'm rollin' around in a mud puddle, and I'm just... lovin's it. Oh, no! Whoo... Remembering is hard work.@The Witch's Garden
Finn@What happened next?!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Oh. Um... I went into the mud, and... I guess I became a magic dog?@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Okay! Then our course is clear! We'll roll you in every mud puddle in Ooo until we find the one that'll restore your powers.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@That's nuts, man. You got any idea of how many mud puddles are in the land of Ooo? Four? Maybe even five?@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Jake, come on! We've always been lucky, buddy! Maybe the first mud puddle we find will be the right one!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Nonsense... but I like it!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Then away! Hyuh! Whoo-hoo!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Yeah, let's do it!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Oh, my gosh!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@I forgot that I don't have magic powers anymore. How do we search for the mud without my powers?@The Witch's Garden
Finn@We run! Run like energetic little boys!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@This whole time, I thought running was some sort of... leg magic. Huh... Look at me. I'm runnin'! Oh, no... Running... is... evil...@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Come on, lazy bones!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@It's too hard!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@I guess you could ride on my backpack.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@I can't reach. You good, Finn?@The Witch's Garden
Finn@You're... strangling me... a little, is all.@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Look there! Across the River of Junk! There's an ideal mud puddle.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@I'll stretch into a boat! I'm startin' to really miss that old magic of mine.@The Witch's Garden
Finn@We can swim this river easy! Come on, Jake!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Man, that looks exhausting.@The Witch's Garden
Jake's subconscious@You're right, Jake. It is exhausting.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@What are you?!@The Witch's Garden
Jake's subconscious@I'm your subconscious!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Okay, what are you doing here?@The Witch's Garden
Jake's subconscious@I'm here to tell you that what you're feeling deep down inside is true! It is way too hard to swim across the river. It's easier to wear a hat. Here! Have a hat!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Ha ha!@The Witch's Garden
Jake & his subconscious@Yeah-hea-hea-hea! Heh heh!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Man, I'm glad I met you.@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Jake! Stop talking to yourself! Cross over already!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Uh, I can't swim that river, dude. My subconscious says it's too hard. Check out this hat, though.@The Witch's Garden
Finn@What's wrong with that guy? Then just wait for me there!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Whatcha workin' on, Finn? Look at you! Doin' stuff! Oh, is it a chair? A chair for my butt—? Mud-venture!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Did it work?!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Oh, yeah! I can feel this workin'! In fact, you should roll in the mud with me, Finn! We can both be magic!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@YEAAAAH! This isn't working at all.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@This isn't the right mud. I was just really hopin' this was over and done.@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Okay... Then let's just go find another mud puddle.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Actually... I'm feeling kinda chubby-tired. Can't we do this tomorrow?@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Agh! This is stupid! Just go back to the witch and apologize and get your powers back!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Never! I'd rather be powerless forever then apologize! I'm lazy but prideful.@The Witch's Garden
Finn@YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING, MAN! First, you won't run, a-and now you keep—and... a-and no matter what, I ju—you...@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Adventuring is too much hard work for a bro without his powers.@The Witch's Garden
Finn@But you are an adventurer.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Nah, from now on, I'm just your regular old dog. ...Ironic given my current man-baby body.@The Witch's Garden
Gary@Behold the beautiful mermaid of the river. Which one of you mortals wants to mate with all this? Heh heh heh...@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Oh, um... How do I say, "You're the grossest thing ever," without offending you?@The Witch's Garden
Gary@RAAAAAARGH!!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@I'll scare her off, Finn!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@How do we beat power like that?!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Finn! I've got an idea!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@What is it, buddy??@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Rub my belly! Yeah, I'm one of those kinda dogs.@The Witch's Garden
Finn@YAAAAH!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Finn? Finn! Come on, Finn! You gotta save yourself! I'm just a dog! Aw, man. Oh, geez... Okay. Then I'm back on the team! I'll save you!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Jake?@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Don't worry! Hey, Finn... Can you help me to get up there?@The Witch's Garden
Hatchlings@Hungry! Hungry! Hungry!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@If only I had my powers back!@The Witch's Garden
Witch@The only way I'll give back your powers is if—@The Witch's Garden
Jake@I know, I know! I have to apologize to that Witch.@The Witch's Garden
Witch@Oh, you're doing so well... and I hate you so much!!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Hey! Witch! I need my powers back! So I'm sorry! I'm so sorry I ate your donut!@The Witch's Garden
Witch@Razzamafoo.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@...Oh. So do I get my powers back?!@The Witch's Garden
Witch@Mmm... Apology denied.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@What?! Why?!@The Witch's Garden
Witch@Because you took too long. Now you have to apologize while doing a variety of humiliating things.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@No way, Jose!@The Witch's Garden
Jake's subconscious@Come on, dude. It's the only way to save Finn.@The Witch's Garden
Witch@Who is that?!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@He's my subconscious.@The Witch's Garden
Witch@Then he has to do it too.@The Witch's Garden
Jake's subconscious@Aw...@The Witch's Garden
Jake@I, Jake the dog, while slow-dancing with my subconscious, with flowers in my underwear, do humbly apologize...@The Witch's Garden
Witch@Wait, wait. Start over.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@You're recording this?!@The Witch's Garden
Witch@It's for my newsletter.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@No way. I have my dignity.@The Witch's Garden
Witch@Then guess what, cool guy? You can forget about getting your powers back... EVER!!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Oh, no, dude! What do we do now?@The Witch's Garden
Jake's subconscious@I'm dyin', Jake.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Wha?!@The Witch's Garden
Witch@Hm. He says he's dying. Let that be a lesson to all you cupcakes. Hah...@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Why are you dying, bro?@The Witch's Garden
Jake's subconscious@Because... I'm the subconscious of your old magical self. Goodbye, Jake...@The Witch's Garden
Jake@No! No!@The Witch's Garden
Witch@So I've finally broken you.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Yeah! If only... I were a humbler guy, my subconscious would be alive, and my best bud wouldn't be trapped in a mermaid's nest!@The Witch's Garden
Witch@YES! GLOAT, GLOAT, GLOAT! Alright, I think you've learned your lesson. I forgive you.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@My powers! How can I ever thank— Ha! Got your cane!@The Witch's Garden
Witch@WHAAA! OOF! But didn't you learn your lesson?!?@The Witch's Garden
Jake@NOPE!!!@The Witch's Garden
Hatchlings@Hungry! Hungry!@The Witch's Garden
Gary@Remember to save the brain for dessert.@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Honey, I'm back! How about a big kiss? You guys are so cute! I could just maul you to death!@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Jake! I never should have doubted you!@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Well, I'm glad you learned your lesson that in a crunch, there's nothin' I wouldn't do for ya.@The Witch's Garden
Finn@Ahhh, so is that how you got your powers back? You apologized to the witch?@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Uh... No way! I must have found the right... mud puddle! Yeah... I don't remember. Heh...@The Witch's Garden
Jake@Hey, man.@What is Life?
Finn@What's so funny?@What is Life?
Jake@Oh, you know, just takin' this garbage bag of butter... ...into the house.@What is Life?
Finn@Dude. That's not that funny. EAAH!!@What is Life?
Jake@HAHAHAHAHA!@What is Life?
Finn@Ohhh, butter pranked! I can't believe I didn't see that coming!@What is Life?
Jake@Heh, yeah, I'm a genius.@What is Life?
Finn@You have offended my honor, sir, and in so doing, you have awoken the pranking demon that sleeps in my pits! The demon is coming for you, mortal. It is going to prank you... so... HARD!@What is Life?
Jake@Whatever. I'm gonna take a day long nap.@What is Life?
Finn@That's right, suckah! Go nap it up, for when you awake, the pranking demon will be upon you! Aww, man! Nothing's better than throwing a big bag of butter at someone! Gotta think! What's... a better prank... than butter?! Answer me, book! What's better than butter?! A unicorn. A treasure hunter! A battleship! A pie! A young girl in lo—Wait! Book, rewind! That's it! I'll throw never-ending pies at Jake's face forever!@What is Life?
Finn@It's never-ending pie-throwing time! C'mon, dude! Turn on! Why isn't it working?! I'll never make a prank better than Jake's garbage bag full of butter.@What is Life?
Neptr@Ouch!@What is Life?
Finn@Holy stuff! It talked! Wow-cow-chow!@What is Life?
Neptr@Greeting, creator!@What is Life?
Finn@Oh, whoa! Hey, man!@What is Life?
Neptr@My name is Neptr, which stands for "Never-Ending Pie-Throwing Robot."@What is Life?
Finn@Oh, perfect! You're exactly the kind of robot I was trying to make!@What is Life?
Neptr@Creator, I am eager to commence the creation and propulsion of pies forever, but my pie-hucking appendage is... malfunctioning, and my oven lamp is cold, and my tank treads do not roll! They only do skids! Why, creator?! Does it please you to watch me struggle?!@What is Life?
Finn@Neptr! Don't say stuff like that! Look, I know we just met, and you're probably goin' through a lot of personal stuff right now, but I really like you, Neptr, and I'm not gonna rest until you're working properly and throwing hot pie on my best friend's face. Together, we're gonna prank the poots out of Jake!@What is Life?
Neptr@Haha! I'll always love you, creator!@What is Life?
Finn@I know you will, Neptr. Now, all we need is more lightning power so you can be operating at full capacity! And I think I know just the dumb-hole who we can get some from.@What is Life?
Neptr@Ooh, what beautiful piles of sugar!@What is Life?
Finn@Heh. No, Neptr. We call that snow.@What is Life?
Neptr@Snoooow??@What is Life?
Finn@UNH! Did y'all smack me into that mountain on purpose?@What is Life?
Balloons@Yeah!@What is Life?
Finn@Take note, Neptr. These guys are grade-A pranksters. You guys hang out in case we need a daring escape!@What is Life?
One Balloon@I got his wallet.@What is Life?
Finn@Just gotta sneak around until we find his lightning bolt stash.@What is Life?
Neptr@But, creator, is not breaking and entering wrong?@What is Life?
Finn@No, we're pranking and entering, which is awesome!@What is Life?
Neptr@Sneaking! We're sneaking...@What is Life?
Finn@Shush, Neptr!@What is Life?
Neptr@Sneaking...@What is Life?
Finn@Shh!@What is Life?
Neptr@Sneaking...@What is Life?
Finn@Neptr, you're gonna get us caught!@What is Life?
Neptr@Sneaking!@What is Life?
Ice King@Is that you, honey? How was your day at work? Terrible! How could I possibly stand to be apart from you, the Ice King?! You see, Gunter, that's how it would go if I actually had a wife.@What is Life?
Penguin@Wenk.@What is Life?
Ice King@Game time! Kill the frog! Kill the frog! C'mon! Oh, he's right in front of you! Lower! L— Stupid lady. Kill it...@What is Life?
Neptr@Creator, if we get caught, I want you to know that I will always love you.@What is Life?
Finn@Shh! You already told me that! And we're not getting caught! We're gonna get you working so you can prank Jake! He could wake up from his nap at any second!@What is Life?
Jake@I might wake up at any moment! Naaaah, I'm still asleep.@What is Life?
Ice King@No, no! That frog is casting magic missiles on my babe!@What is Life?
Finn@Quickly! While he's distracted!@What is Life?
Ice King@No, c'mon, get out of the—UGH! Move!@What is Life?
Penguin@Wenk!@What is Life?
Ice King@Baaaugh! This game cheats anyway! LOOK WHAT YOU DID, GUNTER!!@What is Life?
Finn@We're home free, Neptr.@What is Life?
Penguin@Wenk wenk wenk wenk wenk wenk wenk!@What is Life?
Ice King@What are you on about? You're starting to infuriate me... It's almost like you're trying to alert me—warn me about... I don't know, an intruder or something? Perhaps he's lurking in this very room, just outside my field of vision!@What is Life?
Penguin@Wenk wenk wenk wenk.@What is Life?
Ice King@Well, knock it off!!@What is Life?
Neptr@What'll we do, creator?@What is Life?
Finn@We're gonna prank 'im, Neptr. Hardcore.@What is Life?
Ice King@Hmm. You're looking kinda fat, Gunter! Look at these arms! Fat fat fat! Daddy's little fattie! Oh, you'll never get a prom date with all that chub on your face, you know! Ooh! Oh, blast these melty ceilings!@What is Life?
Finn@Hee hee hee hee!@What is Life?
Neptr@Creator, you have shown me the joys of pranking! I cannot wait to throw pies infinitely at Jake's face!@What is Life?
Finn@The ceiling really is melty! Whoa! Whoa!@What is Life?
Ice King@What was that?@What is Life?
Finn@WAAAAH!@What is Life?
Ice Toads@Alarm! Alarm! Alarm!@What is Life?
Finn@Figs!@What is Life?
Ice King@Huh? An intruder! Maybe a beautiful princess like in my poems.@What is Life?
Finn@We've gotta find that lightning as fast as—@What is Life?
Neptr@Creator! Lightning!@What is Life?
Finn@It's a lightning-shaped door! And we're gonna smash right into it! Hold on, Neptr! I got a plan!@What is Life?
Neptr@That was a great plan!@What is Life?
Finn@Nah, that wasn't my plan. We got lucky!@What is Life?
Neptr@Are those my tickets to the gun show, creator?@What is Life?
Finn@Mm-hmm. You're gonna be fully functional just like I promised.@What is Life?
Ice King@Whoa, ice-o-pede! Finn?! Oh, why can't you ever be a princess?! Ice-o-pede, attack! Ice-o-pede, no! Aaah!@What is Life?
Finn@Let's grab some lightning and get outta here!@What is Life?
Ice King@Hahaha! Finish him off, my semi-loyal pet! An innocent bystander?! ZAP!@What is Life?
Finn@Neptr! NOOOOO! NOOOOOO!—Oh, yeah. That's what we wanted to happen.@What is Life?
Neptr@Neptr is fully functional! Yay!@What is Life?
Finn@Neptr! Yeah!@What is Life?
Ice King@Crush him! Crush him like you crushed me!!@What is Life?
Neptr@Creator?@What is Life?
Finn@Neptr! The pies! Pies!@What is Life?
Neptr@Oh, right!@What is Life?
Ice King@Come on!@What is Life?
Finn@What was in those pies?!@What is Life?
Neptr@Just boysenberry. Hahaha. And also... poison.@What is Life?
Finn@Neptr's acting... different.@What is Life?
Balloons@Quick, Finn! Jump!@What is Life?
Finn@Heh heh. You guys got me.@What is Life?
Ice King@Something about that robot I tried to kill fills me with... deep longing.@What is Life?
Finn@Thanks, guys. Your blood-oath is fulfilled.@What is Life?
Balloons@Yay! To the mesosphere!@What is Life?
One Balloon@Finally we can die!@What is Life?
Neptr@I am troubled, creator. Troubled by a sudden urge to... collect princesses.@What is Life?
Finn@Neptr, that's a heavy unsettling thing to say, but pull yourself together. We're about to prank Jake!@What is Life?
Neptr@Uh-huh. Sure.@What is Life?
Finn@One... two...@What is Life?
Ice King@THREE!@What is Life?
Finn@Run, Neptr!!@What is Life?
Neptr@Oooh!@What is Life?
Finn@Hah! Hah! Hah! Aw, man.@What is Life?
Ice King@I've come to take my son.@What is Life?
Finn@Your son?!@What is Life?
Ice King@Come to Papi, son. I won't attack you... unless provoked.@What is Life?
Finn@He's not your son! If anything, he's my son!@What is Life?
Ice King@It was my power that activated his full potential. Zzz.@What is Life?
Neptr@Oooh...@What is Life?
Ice King@When you were struck by my lightening, you also became infused with my private particles. He wants to be with me, Finn!@What is Life?
Finn@No way! Neptr wants to help me prank Jake!@What is Life?
Neptr@I am torn! I am processing a love for both princesses and pranking!@What is Life?
Ice King@Don't worry, son. I'll show you the life you deserve!@What is Life?
Finn@No! Neptr!@What is Life?
Ice King@Yes! Now that we've entered my imagination zone, allow me to tantalize you with this! Princesses! As my son, you will carry on the tradition of capturing ladies!@What is Life?
Neptr@Tell me more, Papi!@What is Life?
Finn@No, Neptr!@What is Life?
Ice King@I want a son who can do better than I. One who can succeed where I... have failed. You can mate with robot princesses!@What is Life?
Neptr@Can I still prank with Finn after?@What is Life?
Ice King@NO!! I'll show you what will happen if you hang out with Finn!@What is Life?
Imaginary Finn & Jake@Yeah! Pootin' on Neptr to the max!@What is Life?
Neptr@Haha! Yeah, I love Finn's pranks!@What is Life?
Ice King@NOOOOO!! I'm through playing around, son. Who do you choose?@What is Life?

Finn@Jake! Come on!@Ocean of Fear
Jake@I'm just messing with you. I'll do it. Hmm... Where to start? Oh, ok. I think we should just take a few steps in the water. You can hold Jake's hand if you're scared.@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Um... Oh it's ok, dude. I see the problem. It's just your feet.@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop.@Ocean of Fear

Finn@Jake!@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Ok. Ok. I have a plan to get rid of your fear. We'll start tomorrow morning.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@But I must conquer this now! I'm not afraid of you!@Ocean of Fear

Finn@I'm askin'!@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Then get ready for my three-step plan. Watch your troubles melt away with step one!@Ocean of Fear
Finn@Jake, are you crazy? This is not an OK thing to do!@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Hey. Hey. Come on. The ocean is your friend, and you got friends all around you right now. Miles and miles of friends.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@You're nuts.@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Don't try to struggle, man. I'll let you out in a second. You just need to calm down.@Ocean of Fear

Jake@Alright, dude. Step... two!@Ocean of Fear
Finn@Jake, this isn't a joke! It's touching me!@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Let it hold you, man! Let it hold you like a child!@Ocean of Fear
Finn@I'm trying to let it hold me.@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Control your breathing!@Ocean of Fear
Finn@This isn't working!@Ocean of Fear
Jake@That means we gotta move to step three. Just don't scream.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@W-what?@Ocean of Fear
Jake@I'm gonna push you underwater with my jowls. Just don't scream. Don't scream.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@What?!@Ocean of Fear

Jake@Finn! Stop it, Finn! Ow!@Ocean of Fear
Finn@I'm safe! I'm safe! How'd I do?@Ocean of Fear
Jake@I think we should give up.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@What? I made it all the way to level three.@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Look, Finn. It's not that I don't want to help you... I just don't wanna get beat up anymore. I mean this is my bread and butter. I can't have you messing up my bread and butter, dude.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@You have to help me. I can't do this without you.@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Ok. Fine... but only if you swear not to hit me anymore.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@I swear I won't hit you anymore.@Ocean of Fear
Jake@And also swear to only speak in rhymes. Speak in rhymes all the times.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@I swear... and pigs have hair.@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Yes. Perfect. And since you want more... it's time for step four.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@What? I thought you said it was a three step plan... man.@Ocean of Fear

Jake@Check it, dude. One hundred percent awesome-itude.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@Yeah. It's pretty math... you psychopath.@Ocean of Fear
Jake@You know, it looks way more math if you open up your eyes.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@Whoa...@Ocean of Fear
Jake@See, man? The ocean is beautiful. There's no reason to be afraid of things that are beautiful.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@Hey. This isn't that bad. I'm actually glad.@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Hey, look! A black abyss! Let's go check it out... sauerkraut.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@No, Jake! Turn around! Turn around!@Ocean of Fear
Finn@Noooo!@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Saying, "Turn around" twice doesn't count as a rhyme, dude.@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Hey, you swore!@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Ow! My bread and butter!@Ocean of Fear
Jake@No, dude! Don't!@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Don't worry, dude. Everything's cool. This is the perfect segue into level five. Here, put this on.@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Just make sure you don't pull the emergency tab.@Ocean of Fear
Jake@No, dude! I said don't...@Ocean of Fear
Finn@Jake? Jaaaaaake!@Ocean of Fear
Finn@Jake!@Ocean of Fear
Fear Feaster@Pathetic! You can't even overcome your fear now that your friend is about to die! Your un-heroic body will never let you save Jake.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@You're right.@Ocean of Fear
Fear Feaster@What? Really? You think I'm right? Well, that's... that's great!@Ocean of Fear
Finn@If my body won't let me rescue my best friend, then there's only one thing left to do.@Ocean of Fear
Fear Feaster@No. Wait. No! Noooo!@Ocean of Fear
Finn@Jake! Jake! Wake up!@Ocean of Fear
Finn@You ok, dude?@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Yeah, man. Wait... Finn, you did it! You conquered your fear!@Ocean of Fear

Jake@Whoa, dude! What's with your bellybutton?@Ocean of Fear
Finn@What the flip, man? I just swam to the bottom!@Ocean of Fear
Fear Feaster@No you didn't, cheater! You just sank to the bottom. You will never be a great hero.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@He's right. I'll never be a hero.@Ocean of Fear
Wise Man 1@Finn, you are wrong. The mark of a great hero is his flaw.@Ocean of Fear
Fear Feaster@You know nothing, Wise Men!@Ocean of Fear
Wise Man 1@Silence, Fear Feaster! We know a lot!@Ocean of Fear
Finn@Wait... Why did you wait so long to tell me?@Ocean of Fear
Wise Man 1@Because the limo driver's flaw is being late!@Ocean of Fear
Limo Driver@Sorry.@Ocean of Fear
Wise Man 1@Farewell, Finn. You truly are the greatest hero of Ooo.@Ocean of Fear
Finn@It's time for you to go away, Fear Feaster!@Ocean of Fear
Fear Feaster@What? Am I supposed to live in your tummy for the rest of my life?@Ocean of Fear
Finn@Everybody has a flaw... and it looks like yours is smelling like my nasty guts.@Ocean of Fear
Fear Feaster@Wonderful...@Ocean of Fear
Pat McHale@And so fear is forced deep within the soul of a hero. Conquered... at least, for now...@Ocean of Fear
Jake@Are you okay, dude?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Yeah, why?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@You look bored.@When Wedding Bells Thaw

Ice King@Think this is the right address, mmm is this, is this....@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Eiiiiaah!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Yeah! Kick his butt, dude!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Eat my sword, Ice King!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Aww.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@You can not defeat me, child!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@I will, though! With a sweet kick! Psych!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Whoo, hoo hoo!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Now I can kill you! Oh wait, wait, wait. I am so stupid! Silly Billy! I came by to tell you the good news!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@What's the good news?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@I'm getting married... to someone who wants to marry me!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@My betrothed is right over there! Hi, honey!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Old Lady Princess@Hey, cool guy.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@I'm a lucky guy—I didn't even have to kidnap this one! She fell in love with me the moment I slipped on her engagement ring!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Eww.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Old Lady Princess@Bye-bye!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@The lady penguins are throwing her one of those "bachelorette" parties.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@This is weird, dude.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Hmm... if you get married, what about capturing princesses?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Oh well, no more capturing pretty princesses for this Ice King!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Ohhh... well, fare thee well, Ice King!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Hmm?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Yeah, good luck with ye and thy creepy wedding.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@We totally support your decision to stop capturing princesses! I'm happy for him.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Sure wish someone would throw me a bachelorette party—oop, I mean, "man-lorette" party.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@But we hate you.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@If you won't throw me man-lorette party, then I'll never have my last hurrah before buckling down with that battle axe! It'll drive me back to a life of stealing hot princesses! Is that what you want?!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@No. No, no, no, no, no.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Dude, we gotta show him a good time and treat him right. Otherwise, he'll go back to imprisoning ladies! I-I can't have that! I—@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Shhh, I know. I know that you can't have that. Don't worry. Alright, let's go party, Ice King.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Best man-lorette party ever!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Fah! Hahahaha! Now I'm gonna go get married! Hehehehe! ♫I'm gonna get married!♪@When Wedding Bells Thaw

Jake@Have fun being married!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@No more stealing princesses!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Yeah--wait. No more s-stealing princesses? Wow.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn & Jake@What?!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@I didn't realize I'd have to give up stealing the ladies.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@But you said you were fine with it!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@I know what I said, but, y'know, sometimes you say things and then you don't really mean them.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@What? Are you serious?!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@I'm just not sure I wanna get married in such a hurry. What if she's just after my Demonic Wishing Eye and Ghost pouch?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@We just took you out partying so that you could feel better about getting hitched!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Maybe I'll just go back to capturing lots of girls. It's what I feel comfortable doing, y'know? Being free, wind at my back, lots of girls, kidnapping 'em.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Alright, here comes my double kick!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Finn, Finn, cool yourself, buddy. We need to get this guy married, remember?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Yeah, I remember.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Watch. Let big brother handle this. Hey, Ice King? Don't be nervous. Marriage is the most beautiful thing that could ever happen to a jerk like you.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Really? Why?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@"Why?" Poots, that guy is good. Why? Why?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Jake—@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Not now! Why, why, why, why, why?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@My mind is made up—80% sure. No marriage.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Well, uh... don't you wanna grow old with somebody? Right? Just like these old swans.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Bleh, those stinky old swans. Huh?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn & Jake@What?!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Ohhhh, now I get what you guys are trying to tell me! Marriage is a thing that allows me to capture a princess forever and let her live inside of me! Marriage is the most beautiful thing in the world!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Uhh... Yeah—I-I never—uhh... I guess it is. Jake, this is bad news, man! We gotta go tell him that he can't eat his wife!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Eh, let's cross that bridge when we get to it. Look how happy he is.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@The wedding? Back on—100%!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Phew!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@All that's left is the lousy wedding.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@I'm weddy for the wedding!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Y'know, even though the Ice King is a wad, I'm pretty happy for him.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Uh-huh. This wedding looks lame, man. Be prepared to be bored outta your mind.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Finn, Jake, you made it! Come on up here. I'm almost finished tying up my bride.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Weird—and your bride is into that?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@This is a traditional wedding ritual for good luck in the Ice Kingdom. You see, she'll be hoisted up and then lowered down—and when she touches my beard from above, she will be my queen!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Well... cool, man. I'm glad y'all are happy... being crazy together.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Thank you! Excuse me as we finish preparing for the nuptials. 2, 4, 8, 16, 20, uh—@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Snowman Priest@32.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Yes—32, 64, one hundred and—eh.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Huh? Her eyes are huge! I'm gonna go check 'em out. And stop scratching your ear, man—it's gross.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@It wasn't me—it was my foot, dude.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Whoa, you've got ridiculously large eyes, princess! Are you allergic to somethin'?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Old Lady Princess@No, Finn. I was just born like this.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Why are you crying?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Old Lady Princess@I'm not crying, Finn—my tear sac is broken!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Old Lady in eye@Help me!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@What?!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Old Lady Princess@I didn't say anything.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Old Lady in eye@The Ice King cursed me! You've gotta set me free. I would rather die than marry the Ice King!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@He tricked me! And I was happy for that son of a toot!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Look at her ring.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@She fell in love with me the moment I slipped on her engagement ring.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@That's what cursed her! Don't worry, princess. I'll remove this ring and save your life.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@No! She's my love boat!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@No, man. You cursed her. She hates you!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Okay, that's your opinion!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Wait a minute! So you knew she was cursed all along, which means you knew she wasn't trying to steal your Demonic Eye Junk or whatever, and you knew you had total control of her!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Yeah, yes, that's right.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@So then why did you make us go through all that junk about why marriage is worth stuff?!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Oh, I don't know... I'm complicated—and spontaneous! That's probably why she wants to marry me!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@She wants to marry you because you brainwashed her!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Silence!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn & Jake@Whoa, wait! Aw, man!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@It's time for the lowering ceremony! Hoist her up!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Hehehehe! Commence the lowering!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Yes, nothing can stop me now.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Hyah! What is wrong with you, man?!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Strangling the groom's nose at a wedding? What's wrong with you?! You're the one that there's something wrong with!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Gotcha!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Old Lady in eye@Thanks, man@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Hehe, no problem.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Ehh.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@I think you dropped something. Catch!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Huh?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Whoa!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Jake!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Old Lady Princess@Huh, what?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@JAKE! Grrrr. Oh, hey.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Hey.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@You got the ring off her finger?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Huh? Oh. Oh yeah. Now she's not hypnotized, but we're still frozen.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@I got a plan.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Oh, good.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Now, let's try that again. Lower her!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Old Lady Princess@You lousy, butt-faced pig! I hate you!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Here she comes. Yes, touch my beard, deary. Yes, that's right. Almost there...@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@Now!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Oh! I'm married, right, snowman?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Snowman Priest@Yes, it's official.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@It's official! You done married a dog, dude!@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@What? What's that supposed to— Oh no.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Wait, what the—? What am I laughin' about?@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Finn@And now everything's back to normal.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Jake@Well, I wouldn't say everything.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Ice King@Come on, guys. Help me celebrate my un-marriage.@When Wedding Bells Thaw
Princess Bubblegum@Alright, guys. Hammer all these safety signs around this dungeon hole. I've gotta jet off on my swan to take care of some royal junk.@Dungeon
Finn@You got it, Princess.@Dungeon
Jake@Whatever you want, mama.@Dungeon
Princess Bubblegum@Bubblegum, away!!@Dungeon
Jake@Ow. Ow. Ow.@Dungeon
Finn@There. That's the last sign, Jake. Now no one will go down this hole, ever. Probably a lot of dangerous, awesome stuff down this hole. I better go take a look.@Dungeon
Jake@Don't, dude. For you see, that's the secret entrance to the Dungeon of the Crystal Eye!@Dungeon
Finn@Whoa.@Dungeon
Jake@Legend has it that the eye rests in the deepest chamber of this accursed dungeon. Man, we shouldn't even be talkin' about it, 'cause it's lunch time.@Dungeon
Finn@The crystal eye. I wanna meet this dungeon.@Dungeon
Jake@Maybe after lunch.@Dungeon
Finn@Eh, I'll skip lunch. Just catch up with me when you are finished.@Dungeon
Jake@*Pfft* Yeah, right.@Dungeon
Finn@What?@Dungeon
Jake@Without the aid of my magnificent powers... ...Huh? Huh? You'd get killed down there.@Dungeon
Finn@Hey! I can do things without you! You wanna bet I can't?@Dungeon
Jake@Nope. Come get your sandwich. Listen to Jake, Finn. He only wants what's best for-- Ahh! Help me! Ahh! Come put her out of her misery, dude!@Dungeon
Finn@We are betting! I bet that I'll get that crystal eye and be back within 11 minutes. Ready set go!@Dungeon
Jake@I better go after him.@Dungeon
Jake@No, Jake! Stay here, with me...@Dungeon
Jake@Oh, my...@Dungeon
Finn@Dungeons! Chambers! Woah. Evil creatures! Treasure chests!@Dungeon
Finn@Doorways! Traps! I'm in my elemeeeeeeeeent!!@Dungeon
Finn@Aww!@Dungeon
Finn@Oh?@Dungeon
Finn@Whoa! Somebody come pick up your freaky cat.@Dungeon
Demon Cat@Greetings, Frank the Human Boy.@Dungeon
Finn@How did you almost know my name?!@Dungeon
Demon Cat@I have approximate knowledge of many things. For instance, I know that I am possibly going to slay you and munch on your eyeballs.@Dungeon
Finn@Huh, yeah right. That sounds like idiot talk!@Dungeon
Demon Cat@You're trespassing on my dungeon, manling. And I am the thing... ...you should be afraid of.@Dungeon
Finn@You can't hurt me! I'm a radical boy on a mission for the crystal eye!@Dungeon
Demon Cat@I'm going to unzip your skin and wear you like a little coat.@Dungeon
Finn@Unzip this!@Dungeon
Finn@Bleep! OOF!@Dungeon
Demon Cat@Now, you DIE!!@Dungeon
Demon Cat@Wait a minute. Is that dog smell?! You... you have a dog with you? I'm outta here!@Dungeon
Finn@Yeah, right! Good excuse! Slaps, that cat was kicking my buns! And it might have finished my buns if it weren't for Jake's stank. Dang it, Jake! I'll get that crystal eye on my own! With my own odors. Hmm, no to skeletal remains door. No to giant monster mouth door. Oh! Giant key door it is!@Dungeon
Finn@If Jake was here, he could stretch his hand into a key and open it. Yeah! Key hand! Ouch! Hey! What the jug is that?@Dungeon
Finn@Oh, sweet, the key!@Dungeon
Finn@Ew, jelly cube?! Come on! Give it to me! Don't flaunt it if you're not gonna give it up! I'll never get that crystal eye! No. No, I just gotta stay pumped. Pump it up, pump it up! Whoo! Whoo! Shake it! Shake it! Ahh! Steady, Finn. This place is probably more creeped out of you than you are of it.@Dungeon
Bucket Knight@Halt! Come no further adventurer, for you see none can defeat... the Bucket Knight!@Dungeon
Finn@Okay, then I won't fight you.@Dungeon
Bucket Knight@No! You must challenge me to--@Dungeon
Finn@Hey cutie, do you know how to get to the crystal eye from here?@Dungeon
Bucket Knight@Yes, it's through that door over there, but--@Dungeon
Finn@Thanks!@Dungeon
Bucket Knight@Hey! You can't pass through that door with out battling me!@Dungeon
Finn@Yes, I can. Because I'm huge compared to you.@Dungeon
Bucket Knight@Just add water and... ...exponential growth!@Dungeon
Finn@Aw, buckets.@Dungeon
Bucket Knight@Now, activate thine own powers, and we shall engage in thrilling single combat!@Dungeon
Finn@Heh, thing is... I don't really... have any powers.@Dungeon
Bucket Knight@I see...@Dungeon
Finn@AAAAH!! Dang it, Jake wouldn't be running! He'd grow all big, and sock you right in the nose hole! Aw, nutzoids! Come on! All aboard the knuckle train to fist planet!@Dungeon
Finn@Oww... I rode the knuckle train? But... I... I'm in my element.@Dungeon
Finn@AHHHHH!!!! Ow! OW! Ow! OW! Ow! Uhh! That... sucked. Alright, Finn, you're in a heavy pickle here. You don't have Jake, and you're on your own. But you can still handle this. You can still get that crystal eye!@Dungeon
Demon Cat@Hey, my dinner is back. And your dog isn't with you! That's what you said, right? Jack the Dog is not "accompanying" you?@Dungeon
Finn@You mean Jake?@Dungeon
Demon Cat@Jake, Jack, whatever. He's not here, which means I'm going to rip your heart out.@Dungeon
Finn@Crud, crud, crud, crud, crud!@Dungeon
Demon Cat@You can't hide from me, Jim. I know almost everything, remember? I know exactly where you might be, Jim. I'm about to pounce on you.@Dungeon
Demon Cat@One... two... three! Aw, man! I thought you'd be behind this rock. Hmm... Alright. I know where you are now! And I'm about to pounce again! One... two... three! Aw, man! Well, there's only a few more places to look.@Dungeon
Finn@Oh, Jake... I'm such a fool. A silly, silly fool. Who the heck--?!@Dungeon
Guardian Angel@Heeey, it's okay. Shhh, I'm your guardian angel, Finn. I'm here to save you.@Dungeon
Finn@Re...really?@Dungeon
Guardian Angel@Mmm-hm. Come here, let the angel pick you up.@Dungeon
Finn@Okay. This is radical.@Dungeon
Guardian Angel@Are you comfortable? Would you like some snacks?@Dungeon
Finn@I'm fine, thank you.@Dungeon
Guardian Angel@Here, let me clean you up, and mend your clothes.@Dungeon
Finn@Ha ha!@Dungeon
Guardian Angel@I'm taking you to the chamber of the Crystal Eye....@Dungeon
Finn@Aww, yeah!@Dungeon
Guardian Angel@... where I'm going to cook you and eat your flesh.@Dungeon
Finn@Wow... Wait! What??!@Dungeon
Guardian Angel@Trust in your guardian angel!@Dungeon
Finn@Put me down, lady!@Dungeon
Guardian Angel@As you wish.@Dungeon
Finn@Man, everybody wants to eat me up. It's probably 'cause I'm so sweet.@Dungeon
Guardian Angel@Now for little kid soup. The secret is a low flame over a long period.@Dungeon
Finn@That's Jake's secret, too. I sure hope he saves me.@Dungeon
Guardian Angel@I will save thee, Finn.@Dungeon
Finn@Lady, you are sick! Oh, Jake...@Dungeon
Jake@What?@Dungeon
Finn@Jake!@Dungeon
Jake@Finn!@Dungeon
Finn@Where were you?!@Dungeon
Jake@I was looking for you, knucklehead! I was so worried, that right after lunch, I plunged into the dungeon after you.@Dungeon
Jake@Strangest thing, though, I kept runnin' into obstacles.@Dungeon
Reaper@Choose your dueling weapon!@Dungeon
Jake@Uh... I choose... sandwich!@Dungeon
Jake@The challenges were impossible for me.@Dungeon
Jake@But you would have blown right through. I kept thinking to myself, "What would Finn do?" Just...eh, frustrating. Know what I mean?@Dungeon
Finn@Yeah... I think I do.@Dungeon
Finn@Now let's find a way out of this cage.@Dungeon
Jake@I'll get us out with Key Hand!@Dungeon
Finn@I really don't see any key holes on this cage.@Dungeon
Jake@Not a problem, man. Lock Hand!@Dungeon
Finn@I'll get us out of here, with carrot hand!@Dungeon
Jake@Alright, man. Let's go! We've still got a couple minutes left to steal that crystal eye and win your bet!@Dungeon
Finn@Wait! You'd help me win a bet that I made that I said I could accomplish something without you?@Dungeon
Jake@Just hop on my powdered doughnut, boy!@Dungeon
Finn@Cling!@Dungeon
Jake@Alright, man. Let's give this crystal eye the old friendship lift.@Dungeon
Finn@Okay.@Dungeon
Both@Friendship, go!@Dungeon
Finn@If I die, I'll have died with my best friend!@Dungeon
Jake@Me, too!@Dungeon
Princess Bubblegum@Get on my swan!@Dungeon
Princess Bubblegum@I hope you learned a lesson from all this!@Dungeon
Both@Uh, we learned that working together is better. Heh, whatever.@Dungeon
Jake@Looks like that's not the answer she wanted.@Dungeon
Finn@Uhh... I learned that you're a very... intelligent princess?@Dungeon
Princess Bubblegum@You're darn right I am. Princess Bubblegum, away!!@Dungeon
Jake@Here, try throwing this one.@The Duke
Jake@Here's one called Caturday Surprise.@The Duke
Finn@Throw it!@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@Yeah, go on, get out of here! Unless you feel like a fist cookie, you better keep runnin'!@The Duke
Finn@What the heck is goin' on?@The Duke
Jake@I have no idea. But it's probably best to stay out of it.@The Duke
Finn@Yeah. Hey, look. This one looks stupid. Let's see how it flies! Aw, lame.@The Duke
Jake@Uh-oh...@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@Duke of Nuts! What have you done?!@The Duke
Duke of Nuts@Oh...@The Duke
Finn@Oh no! She thinks that nuts guy did it. We gotta go clear up what happened!@The Duke
Dr. Ice Cream@Don't worry, my dear. I'll have you fixed up in no time!@The Duke
Finn@Princess! Are you OK?@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@Yeah, I guess if green and bald is okay.@The Duke
Jake@Oh boy. I'm sorry! I can't stop now.@The Duke
Dr. Ice Cream@My dear, not to worry! The medicine milk in this suit will have you healed lickety-split! In just five days you'll be back to your beautiful bubblegummy self.@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@Five days?! The Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty is tonight!@The Duke
Finn@Uh... hey, Princess. There's something I should tell you about that bottle that hit you in the face.@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@I already know, Finn! The Duke of Nuts has always been a bad guy. But now that he's done this, I'll never forgive him! And it's not just because I hate the Duke! I'd never forgive anybody who did this to me! I'd hate them!@The Duke
Finn@Yeah but-@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@FOREVER!@The Duke
Finn@Forever?@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@Finally. I have a witness to his misdeeds!@The Duke
Jake@Two witnesses!@The Duke
Finn@Jake!@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@Oh Finn, my flawless, flawless champion, bring the Duke of Nuts to justice. The justice of a cold dungeon!@The Duke
Jake@Heheh. She's completely bonkers.@The Duke
Finn@What do I do? If I tell her I threw it, she'll hate me forever!@The Duke
Jake@Don't worry! That won't happen. We're gonna catch that Duke!@The Duke
Finn@But we're the ones who threw the bottle!@The Duke
Jake@Dude, look. The Duke of Nuts is bad guys.@The Duke
Finn@How do you know that?@The Duke
Jake@Think about it. If Bubblegum hates him so much, then he must have done some rotten stuff. I mean, maybe he even threw a bottle and turned someone ugly before.@The Duke
Finn@Maybe you're right.@The Duke
Jake@Maybe I am!@The Duke
Finn@Alright, just this once, we'll be vigilantes!@The Duke
Jake@Nah, we're more like cops. Crooked cops!@The Duke
Finn@Princess! I won't rest until the villainous duke is captured!@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, thank you, Finn!@The Duke
Finn@Woah. Okay, and by then, hopefully you'll have taken care of...this.@The Duke
Finn@Look yonder! The Duke of Nuts castle!@The Duke
Finn@Duke of Nuts!@The Duke
Jake@How are you?@The Duke
Finn@By order of Princess...@The Duke
Finn@Um, Princess...@The Duke
Duchess of Nuts@Hello, Finn. Are you here to arrest the Duke?@The Duke
Finn@How did you know?@The Duke
Duchess of Nuts@The nuts told me...for I am the Duchess of Nuts!@The Duke
Jake@Oh... should've asked if these were, like, her eggs or something.@The Duke
Duchess of Nuts@I know of my husband's crime against the princess. A crime that you personally witnessed! And why would you lie? Huh?@The Duke
Finn@Yeah, why?@The Duke
Duchess of Nuts@Oh but he was once such a wonderful man! He'd pet dogs, kissed babies; we'd lie together underneath the cashew bush. He even taught under-privileged nuts how to dance. But somehow he's gone rancid! These nuts tell me he must be executed. Would you like to hear what my nuts have to say?!@The Duke
Finn@That won't be...um...necessary.@The Duke
Duchess of Nuts@Listen! Listen!@The Duke
Jake@Woah!@The Duke
Finn@I don't get it, Jake. How can the dude be evil if he pets puppies, kisses babies, and lies with his wife?@The Duke
Jake@What?! You believe that? She is nuts. Listen, man. Let's just go back and face the music. Who cares if Bubblegum hates you forever? It's no biggie. Tons of people hate me!@The Duke
Squirrel@Why, Jake? Why won't you print my letters? I...I...I HATE YOU!@The Duke
Finn@Hmm. It's him! The Duke of Nuts!@The Duke
Finn@I'll break left! You take the right!@The Duke
Jake@I went left too!@The Duke
Finn@Wha-? You're way smaller than I thought you were!@The Duke
Jake@Dude. That's not him.@The Duke
Marquis of Nuts@No one will harm the Duke of Nuts! I will kill whoever seeks to arrest him!@The Duke
Duke of Nuts@No! Please! This has gone far enough!@The Duke
Jake@That's the Duke of Nuts.@The Duke
Marquis of Nuts@But I vowed to kill whoever did this to you. They can't take you away, Dad!@The Duke
Duke of Nuts@Who's the toughest little nut? That's you. One second.@The Duke
Finn@Man, I don't know, Jake. Why would Princess Bubblegum hate him if he's such a nice guy?@The Duke
Jake@Just because he's a good father, doesn't necessarily mean he isn't a villain.@The Duke
Finn@That doesn't look like a villain.@The Duke
Jake@I can probably think of a reason why that's villainous if you gave me enough time. Maybe.@The Duke
Finn@Ugh! Maybe we should just confess. But then, Princess Bubblegum will hate us forever.@The Duke
Jake@Hey man, it's not that bad being hated.@The Duke
Squirrel@C'mon man, pick it up!@The Duke
Squirrel@You son of a bleeblop!@The Duke
Duke of Nuts@Oh! Sorry to make you wait. I made these daisy crowns for you guys as a- as a token of gratitude for waiting. Oh...sorry I....I have to sit down for a second. I know this is an odd question, but you wouldn't happen to have any pudding on you, would you?@The Duke
Finn@Actually yeah, I think I have one in my pack.@The Duke
Duke of Nuts@Oh, thank goodness.@The Duke
Finn@I think I have a spoon in here too- wha-?@The Duke
Jake@What happened to the cup?@The Duke
Duke of Nuts@Oh, I'm so embarrassed! Now you know my shame. I can't stop eating pudding.@The Duke
Finn@What?!@The Duke
Duke of Nuts@I don't tell people because I hate making them worry, but yes, I have a rare condition. A pudding deficiency. And I always end up eating all of the royal pudding supply whenever I go to the castle.@The Duke
Finn@So that's why Princess Bubblegum hates you!@The Duke
Duke of Nuts@Yes, but I didn't turn Princess Bubblegum green and bald! I would never do such a thing!@The Duke
Finn@Gah! Of course you wouldn't! You're too nice a guy. I'm the one who threw that bottle. I was gonna tell her, but then-- she started talking all crazy-- she said she'd never forgive me and I-- I didn't know!@The Duke
Duke of Nuts@Hey, it's okay. People make mistakes. It's all part of growing up and you never truly stop growing.@The Duke
Finn@Now you're making me feel even worse by being so nice about it.@The Duke
Duke of Nuts@Maybe I should just confess the crime and end all of this.@The Duke
Finn@Wait...I think I might have an idea that will save everyone's reputations.@The Duke
Finn@Halt!@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@Finn! Did you find the duke yet?@The Duke
Finn@Not yet, but you are in grave danger, Princess. There is an assassin in these very woods, dead set on stopping you from reaching the Grand Meeting. In fact, what's that rustling in the bush??@The Duke
Jake@Rustle. Rustle, rustle. I'm an ambush! Halt!@The Duke
Finn@What's going on?!@The Duke
Jake@Oh, Did I come out to early?@The Duke
Finn@What are you here to do, stranger?@The Duke
Jake@I've come for the princess. I'm an assassin!@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@Um, guys?@The Duke
Finn@Stand back! I will stop him! Hi-yah!@The Duke
Jake@Hi-yah!@The Duke
Jake@I will kill you! And raise your children as my own!@The Duke
Finn@Hi-yaah!@The Duke
Jake@Hah!@The Duke
Finn@Remember, it's just acting, Jake!@The Duke
Jake@Sorry, dude! Now, to kill you up. But wait, surely this cannot be the fair Princess Bubblegum! Where are her pink, flush cheeks? The long gooey hair? Clearly, the princess travels elsewhere. Later, Bubblegum! Get out there, man!@The Duke
Duke of Nuts@I don't know if I can do this.@The Duke
Jake@Go, go, go, go!@The Duke
Duke of Nuts@And that's how I, the Duke of Nuts, by disfiguring you beyond all recognition, humbly saved your life.@The Duke
Jake@Yeah, alright!@The Duke
Finn@Yeah!@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@What was the point of this little play again? And why isn't the duke clapped in irons?!@The Duke
Duke of Nuts@She's right. Innocent or not, I should accept what's coming to me.@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@Peppermint Butler!@The Duke
Finn@Oh, no!@The Duke
Duke of Nuts@Nuttin's going my way today.@The Duke
Finn@No!@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@Finn?@The Duke
Finn@The duke didn't throw that bottle! Ahh- Princess, I have something sucky to confess. I'm the one who threw the bottle. I'm sorry, but I knew if I told you, you'd hate me forever!@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@Hmm...well, I could never stay mad at you forever. And you seem genuinely penitent.@The Duke
Finn@I don't even know what that means, but thank you!@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@But that doesn't douse my hatred for the duke!@The Duke
Finn@Yeah, what's up with that hate?@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@That jerk always empties out my pudding pantry!@The Duke
Finn@Aw, shucks. He just can't control himself around pudding. He goes cocoa-nuts for it! Because he has a pudding deficiency!@The Duke
Duke of Nuts@It's true, your majesty. I'm sorry for my medical condition.@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, my, you poor man! Of course you're forgiven! Yeah, I don't believe a word from him.@The Duke
Finn@I'm really sorry about making you temporarily ugly, Princess. Especially before the Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty. I wish there was some way to make it up to you.@The Duke
Princess Bubblegum@Maybe there is, Finn. Maybe there is... hey!@The Duke
Finn@Hmm, what? You said maybe.@The Duke
Turtle King@Call to order the sesquicentennial Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty. I now call upon the delegate from the Candy Kingdom. Princess Bubblegums?@The Duke
Finn@Ahem! It would be presumptuous indeed to present myself against the distinguished princess to whom you have listened.@The Duke
Jake@Buy a lady a drink?@The Duke
Finn and Jake@The Marquis of Nuts?!@The Duke
Marquis of Nuts@Yes, but I didn't come alone!@The Duke
Squirrel@Remember me, Jake?!@The Duke
Jake@...nope.@The Duke
Finn@Walking, walking, walking – hambone break!@Freak City
Jake@WooHoo! Hey!@Freak City
Jake@Get away from me. Quit it.@Freak City
Off screen@Food for a beggar…@Freak City
Man@Food for a poor old man?@Freak City
Jake@Whoa!@Freak City
Finn@Geez Louise, guy@Freak City
Man@So you got any, kid? Food?@Freak City
Finn@I got this little piece of sugar. Nuts, I'm freaking all about sugar. But I am even more about feeding hobos!@Freak City
Jake@Whoa, man. Maybe helping this starving homeless guy is wrong thing to do.@Freak City
Finn@Why?@Freak City
Jake@I don't know. I said "Maybe" @Freak City
Finn@A hero always helps someone in need and besides he's probably a secret elf who will reward us for being nice. Here you go, buddy.@Freak City
Man@You know, believe or not, I'm not really a beggar. I'm actually a… Magic Man!@Freak City
Finn and Jake@Whoa!@Freak City
Finn@Aw, yeah!@Freak City
Jake@He's magic! I didn't expect this.@Freak City
Magic Man@Magic.... Away!@Freak City
Jake@Think happy thoughts… Little, cute, bees, little babies, tiny, tiny bunnies.@Freak City
Finn@what is wrong with you, Magic Man?!@Freak City
Magic Man@You gave me that candy now I'll do you a favor in return. A magic favor. A mystical, magical favor!@Freak City
Jake@Whoa, dude!@Freak City
Magic Man@...For you!@Freak City
Finn@why did you do that!?@Freak City
Magic Man@Because on this day, a magical life lesson comes to you.@Freak City
Finn@No! Change me back.@Freak City
Magic Man@Not until you appreciate what a jerk I am. Wazoo! @Freak City
Jake@What a nutty guy@Freak City
Finn@What the heck, man?? What kind of deal is that? I help somebody out and they make me a stinky foot.@Freak City
Jake@You smell pretty good.@Freak City
Finn@Get off of me, man! I can't be a hero if I'm a big good-smelling foot!@Freak City
Jake@Maybe you're looking at this magic gift all wrong. Now that you're a huge foot you can kick evil's butt, like, way more times as hard. You're 100% kick, man!@Freak City
Finn@Why are you being so level-headed about this?@Freak City
Jake@Don't be a siss, Finn. Here, c'mon kick my butt.@Freak City
Finn@You're the SISS, siss! Augh!@Freak City
Jake@Ouch! oooh! Ouch. See, man. Let's give your foot body a shot.@Freak City
Finn@No, dude! I wanna go find that magic man and get my body back!@Freak City
Jake@Shhh shhh shhh shhh. Just be a foot for a little bit@Freak City
Jake as Finn@Ok, I will.@Freak City
Jake@Awesome! Dude you will never regret this. Hahaha!@Freak City
Jake@Okay, when the next monster comes along, he'll step on that trigger over there, sending your giant foot body into the monster's crotch!@Freak City
Finn@This sucks, dude.@Freak City
Jake@Shhh!@Freak City
Monster@We're evil! Our crotch! our evil crotch!!@Freak City
Jake@Hahaha! What'd I tell you? You're a great hero! Let's go set up some more crotch catapults so we can laugh and be heroes.@Freak City
Finn@No, Jake. Let's find that Magic Man.@Freak City
Jake@Finn, being an enormous crotch-kicking foot is a gift. Don't scorn a gift.@Freak City
Jake@Town on fire! This looks like a job for foot Finn stomping ability!@Freak City
Finn@But I-I can't even bend these big fat toes, man.@Freak City
Jake@You can do it, Finn. What'd I teach you, dude?@Freak City
Finn@Not to scorn the kicking of people in the crotch?@Freak City
Jake@You got it! Now I'm gonna go rescue all the babies in town --only the babies. Get your hero on, dude!@Freak City
Finn@Aaahh!@Freak City
Finn@Uhh. Okay, you can do this, Finn. Start small, man. I'm taking you down!@Freak City
Finn@It's hot! Oh, man, I'm smoking hot! Please, help me out! I can't move!@Freak City
Townsperson (red shirt)@It's another one of those freaks!@Freak City
Townsperson (green shirt)@He probably started this fire!@Freak City
Finn@No, I didn't start any –@Freak City
Townsperson (blue shirt)@Throw him under the bridge with the others!@Freak City
Townspeople (all)@Get rid of the freak. Freak! Freak!@Freak City
Finn@Unh! I'm not a freak, I'm a hero.@Freak City
Jake@Finn!@Freak City
Finn@Jake, how'd you find me?@Freak City
Jake@Oh, I can sense when you're about to cry. It's like a mother/daughter thing.@Freak City
Finn@I'm not going to cry, man! I just feel like crying. We have to find that magic guy and get my body back now!@Freak City
Jake@What we have to do is find out what reeks under this bridge@Freak City
Finn@Jake!@Freak City
Jake@Ew, it's blocking out your good foot smell.@Freak City
Finn@Get back here!@Freak City
Jake@Ugh, it—it smells like vomit on fire. It's like fancy cheese in an old guy's mouth.@Freak City
Cyclops@Welcome, travelers.@Freak City
Jake@Ahh!@Freak City
Cyclops@I am Gork, leader of Freak City. Ah, I can see one of you has felt the Magic Man's touch.@Freak City
Finn@Yeah! You know that guy?@Freak City
Gork@I will tell you all that I know.@Freak City
Gork@We are the accursed ones, all once normal guys and gals who crossed paths with the Magic Man. That's Zap, the Arm. Trudy, the Waist. That's Wee Wee and Gorflax. They were turned into tonsils and that's Kim. But, please, make yourselves at home. Would you like something to drink?@Freak City
Jake@Do you have any orange juice?@Freak City
Gork@No. Well, uh, I don't know. Maybe. Uh, I don't think so. I'll go check.@Freak City
Jake@Yo, Finn, this place is really bumming me out. Let's get out of here.@Freak City
Finn@What?! No, dude. These guys might be my only hope of finding the Magic Man.@Freak City
Gork@Hey, we actually do have orange juice.@Freak City
Finn@Thanks for being cool and all, but what do you know about this Magic Man? How do we catch him?@Freak City
Gork@Oh, he can't be caught. He's got magic and we're worthless freaks. We can't ever beat him. So we've gather here to wallow in our self-pity.@Freak City
Finn@But don't y'all even want to try?@Freak City
Kim@Eh, no.@Freak City
Finn@Why not? You're all totally miserable here.@Freak City
Zap@Ugh. It's a living.@Freak City
Finn@No, it's not, Zap! It's not a living! It's dookie diapers! I don't want to be a foot!@Freak City
Trudy@Well, get used to it. We did.@Freak City
Jake@Yeah, Finn, maybe there's another lesson to be learned here--@Freak City
Jake@To accept what fate has given you and stay a miserable foot. Gork, can we stay here in this pile of trash and rats forever?@Freak City
Gork@Yeah, man. Do it up.@Freak City
Jake@Awesome. Here we go.@Freak City
Finn@Jake, stop screwing around. You're gonna make me give into depression.@Freak City
Jake@Eh, what are you going to do about it? Probably nothing, right? If you're depressed, you'll do nothing.@Freak City
Finn@I… Maybe I will do nothing.] Maybe I'll just lay down here. Lay down –uh —and rot like the rest of you.@Freak City
Jake@Yeah! Stay a foot! Stay a foot! Stay a foot!@Freak City
Finn@♫ Is this really my life? Is this how my story ends? Bein' in this body, Seems like a battle that I cannot win. Maybe I should lay my head down slow, And sleep until it's all over, Is this the end, of the hero boy named Finn? Heck no! Darn it, no! This isn't how I go! I'm gonna kill it! I'm gonna kick life's butt, And win it, to win it. I'm gonna take life's name, And spit on it, and kick it! Life can just go eat it, 'Cause this is a man's game! ♫@Freak City

Finn@Give us our bodies back!@Freak City
Magic Man@Why should I? You still act like a hero only so you can get what you want.@Freak City
Finn@Oh. You were trying to teach us to be kind without expecting anything return. I should've given you that sugar cube without even thinking about a reward.@Freak City
Magic Man@Wrong!@Freak City
Finn@Ah, geez!@Freak City
Jake@Finn!@Freak City
Finn@You've gifted us nothing but heartache, Magic Man! What is the life lesson in that?!@Freak City
Magic Man@Yes, my children, you are so close to the answer.@Freak City

Zap@Yeah, we're strong together@Freak City
All@Bye, Finn! Thank you!@Freak City
Finn@Oh, okay. Bye, guys. See you, later. Wait, so, what was the lesson we just learned?@Freak City
Jake@Maybe it was, don't give your sugar to jerks.@Freak City
Finn@Speaking of jerks, what the blubbins, man?! Why wouldn't you help me turn back into a boy?!@Freak City
Jake@Well, because I kind of always wanted@Freak City
Finn@What?@Freak City
Jake@I said, I kind of always wanted to be a foot myself.@Freak City
Finn@You could be a foot right now. I saw you change into a foot twice yesterday.@Freak City
Jake@It's complicated, man. You'll understand when you're older.@Freak City
Finn@Safety! Patrol!@Donny
Jake@Safety! Patrol! Safety patrol! Safety— Oh... Were we not wearing the uniforms?@Donny
Finn@C'mon. Let's keep lookin' for hazards. Look out!@Donny
Jake@What is it, dude?@Donny
Finn@Shushers, man! Look there!@Donny
Jake@Just looks like an ordinary little town, man.@Donny

Donny@Haha! Hey, chicken, you're travelin' egg-spress!@Donny
Finn@It's an obnoxious grass ogre.@Donny
Donny@You get my joke, right?! Hahaha!@Donny

Jake@Donny is one mixed-up dude.@Donny
Finn@Nah. He's just rough-and-tumble, like me, but deep down, he's probably really sensitive, like me.@Donny
Jake@You're a mixed-up dude, too!@Donny
Finn@Hey, Donny!@Donny
Donny@What?@Donny
Finn@I was thinkin' that since you're a pretty good wrestler, maybe you'd wanna hang out with a couple a' rascals like me and Jake!@Donny
Jake@What?@Donny
Donny@Muuuh... I don't know. Messin' with these housies is pretty fun. You got somethin' better?@Donny
Jake@You sure this is a good idea?@Donny
Finn@If you come to the Tree Fort, we got video games and apple juice!@Donny
Donny@Really?! I mean... if it keeps you from cryin'...@Donny
Finn@Donny's problem is that he's treated like an outsider, like me.@Donny
Jake@You are not an outsider. You wear cute little blue shorts!@Donny
Finn@I... am complicated.@Donny
Donny@Uh... This fort isn't so great. Not as cool as the fort I'm gonna build. I call this chair!@Donny
Finn@Hey, Donny, you should play Bug Battle.@Donny
Jake@And hey, can you put on some pants?!@Donny
Donny@You put on some pants!@Donny
Jake@I have pants... spun from spiderwebs... by pixies.@Donny
Finn@Okay. There's you, and here come the bugs.@Donny
Donny@Huh?!@Donny
Finn@Oh, yeah. Those guys'll get ya.@Donny
Donny@Urgh!! This game cheats!@Donny
Jake@Not cool, dude.@Donny
Finn@Have more apple juice. It always makes me feel better when I— Aaah! Donny! Quit being a jerk!@Donny
Donny@What? What'd I do?@Donny
Jake@Finn, I don't think this is gonna work.@Donny
BMO@I am incapable of all emotion.... but you are making me chafed!!@Donny
Donny@Everybody's gettin' mad at me for nothin'!@Donny
Finn@You have to think about how your actions make other people feel.@Donny
Donny@Ohh. Hmm. I don't understand at all.@Donny
Jake@Ooh! Teach him that little empathy song I taught you!@Donny
Finn@Okay, yeah! Empathy, empathy, put yourself in the place of me! Your turn!@Donny
Donny@Uh... Empathy, empathy, put yourself... Ohh! So it's like, when I squeeze eggs outta chickens, I should let them squeeze eggs outta me, too!@Donny
Finn@...Um... kinda right. Someone needs our help! Jake, you stay here and try to fix him, while I deal with an unknown possibly deadly emergency!@Donny
Jake@Dude, trade me jobs.@Donny
Donny@Jake! Someone broke your... um... entire living room!@Donny
Bank House@Quick! Act abandoned!@Donny
Finn@Hands off the housing market! BACKPACK! Werewolves. Much worse than ogres.@Donny
Jail House@Stop in the name of the law!@Donny
Finn@Is there somewhere I can trap that thing?@Donny
Jail House@Well, there was a zoo, but he moved back east. Course, there's always the old well.@Donny
Well@I'm not old!@Donny
Finn@Perfect! Slam-bam-in-a-can! Huh? Another werewolf?!? What's up with this town?!@Donny
Finn@Mr. Bank! Are you alright?!@Donny
Bank House@Oh, it's fine, it's fine. All my assets are insured. Pardon. I have to go spackle my cracks.@Donny
Finn@Why is this town just getting worse and worse?@Donny
Wolf@Yes! Why indeed!!@Donny
Finn@Hey! What are you werewolves up to?!@Donny
Wolf@We're not werewolves... We're Why-wolves.@Donny
Finn@Uh... Why-wolves?@Donny
Why-wolf@Creatures possessed by the spirit of inquiry..... AND... BLOODLUST!!@Donny
Finn@What?!@Donny
Why-wolf@Please. Save your questions until the end of the lecture. Our ecosystem. At the bottom level are the house people. Given the opportunity, we Why-wolves would easily wipe them out. However, Donny's presence is a natural deterrent. His jerkiness is so powerful that it produces a pungent gas—obnoxygen. To Why-wolves, it is a deadly poison. But since you've removed the jerk Donny, we will devour the houses, and our population will rapidly swell until we are, in turn, devoured by the Cosmic Owl. Such is the course of nature, but it'll be a pretty sweet ride up until that point. TONIGHT, WE FEAST ON THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS!@Donny
Finn@Oh, no! I have to get Donny back!@Donny
Finn@Donny, you have to go right now, and stop the Why-wolves from—@Donny
Donny@Ah! Master Finn has returned!@Donny
Finn@What's it goin'?!@Donny
Donny@Thanks to you, I shall never be jerky again!@Donny
Finn@Oh, no... Oh, no. Oh, no, nonononononono! No! This is all wrong! We need jerk Donny to make the obnoxygen, and, and—@Donny
Donny@Steady on, Finn. Perhaps you are dehydrated! It's as Jake taught me "8 ounces, 8 glasses, 8 days a week!" I'll fetch you some tap water.@Donny
Finn@Are you wearing jeans now?!@Donny
Donny@Surely! Gotta get pants! Go get your pants! Button, fly! I wrote that one myself. Perdoname.@Donny
Finn@But, but, but—@Donny
Jake@Butt, butt, butt! Yeah, Donny! You're lookin' good in those jeans!@Donny
Finn@What did you do?!@Donny
Jake@Miraculous, isn't it? I just kept teachin' him my musical rules, and now, he's perfect.@Donny
Finn@No! We messed up, Jake! The House People are doomed if Donny doesn't go back to being town jerk!@Donny
Donny@I have no intention of being a jerk again. Hmph.@Donny
Finn@But the housies will be wiped out if you don't!@Donny
Donny@It sounds tragic, but I'm turning over a new leaf!@Donny
Finn@Donny, you gotta go!@Donny
Donny@Finn, "no" means, "no." I'm sure you'll respect my wishes. No! Stop! No!@Donny
Finn@Now, go be a jerk to those Why-wolves!@Donny
Donny@No! I'll use my musical messages to stop them! Let's see... I've got one on the ethics of laundry... Crosswalk-ery... Ooh! Here's a good one!@Donny
Finn@Man! The town is getting creamed! By not being a jerk, you're being a real jerk, Donny!!@Donny
Donny@Comb your hair right! It's a good time! Sticky, sticky pomades, short back and sides! Why isn't anybody paying attention to my words?@Donny
Finn@He sure is sensitive about his songs! It's cuz they think your songs are dumb!@Donny
Donny@Wha?!@Donny
Jake@What're you saying?! If you don't encourage his talent, he might revert back to jerk Do— OHHH, OHHH! HEY, DONNY! EVERYONE SAYS YOUR SONGS ARE SUPER BALLS!!@Donny
Finn@They all think you're a real jerk!@Donny
Donny@But... but I've changed! Why would they say that?! Empathy, empathy, put your mind insi...@Donny
Why-wolf@You're so pathetic! So comical!@Donny
Donny@Rrrrr... Think I'm a jerk do they? I'm feelin'.. obnoxious!! HEY, YOU WHY-WOLVES ARE COOL! JUST KIDDING! HAHAHAHA!!@Donny
Why-wolf@Obnoxygen cloud!! EGRESS!!@Donny
House People@The town is saved!!@Donny
Donny@Get offa' me, nerds!!@Donny
Finn@You did it, Donny! You're a full-blown jerk again!@Donny
Donny@What?! You're the jerk!! Housies! Ready to hear my new song?! It's about how Finn will betray you, just to save lives!@Donny
Finn@I'm sorry, Donny.@Donny
Donny@I'll never forgive you, Finn!! WAAAAAAH!!!@Donny
Jake@C'mon. We can go stare wistfully at the lake.@Donny
Finn@I'd... I'd like that. Very much.@Donny
Donny@Hey! I love bein' a jerk! Thanks, Finn! Finn? Finn, you loser! I'll never... forget you!@Donny

Marceline@You're lucky, Finn. Your first job as henchman is to help me feed.@Henchman
Finn@Feed?! What does she mean? L-Like, like, oats? Like, sentient beings, or oats?! It doesn't matter! I can handle it!@Henchman
Marceline@Sounds like dinner. Finn, open the door. OPEN IT ALREADY!@Henchman
Finn@No way, Marceline! I'm not gonna open this door if innocent people will be hurt!@Henchman
Marceline@Aren't you bound by your word to do as I say, hero?@Henchman
Finn@I... Yes...@Henchman
Eberhardt@Huh?@Henchman
Finn@Sorry about this.@Henchman
Eberhardt@Haah!@Henchman
Marceline@Hold him down! Are you enjoying this, Finn?@Henchman

Marceline@Hey, Finn. You thinkin' about how that guy's bow tie sorta looked like a bra?@Henchman
Finn@Huh? No!@Henchman
Marceline@I know this place seems a little dead, but don't worry. It'll soon be undead. Corpses buries in mud that's black, from death I command you to come back! Hahaha! Are you ready to lead an evil army of the undead?!@Henchman
Finn@Uhh, NEVER! Okay! I'll do it!@Henchman

Finn@What?!@Henchman
Marceline@Use my ax bass.@Henchman
Finn@I'm gonna murder you. I'm not entirely sure why. I'm sure this will end happy... AAH! I don't get it! There's always a twist to the stuff Marceline makes me do, but where's the twist in bumping off this bush?!@Henchman
Marceline@There is no twist. Kill it now!@Henchman
Finn@But wh—@Henchman
Marceline@You should've hacked it to pieces when it was still adorable...@Henchman
Finn@I-I thought— Sick!!@Henchman
Marceline@Oh, boy... Not bad... for a henchman.@Henchman
Finn@Hmm...@Henchman
Finn@Hey. Can't the sun, like, destroy you?@Henchman
Marceline@Yeah, it hurts, but I kinda like it. Reminds me of when I'd scrape my knees up as a kid, and my mom would patch me up... you know what I'm sayin'?@Henchman
Finn@Uh... Jake told me I came out of a cabbage.@Henchman
Marceline@Hey, Finn, I need you to strangle some pixies.@Henchman
Finn@Yeah, sure. That sounds good.@Henchman
Marceline@Whoa, why are you being so casual about that? Strangling pixies is some hardcore evil.@Henchman
Finn@I'm not fallin' for your junk anymore, lady! You just like sayin' poop that jacks with my brain!@Henchman
Marceline@What are you talking about? I... Dang, man, I didn't think you'd ever catch on!@Henchman
Finn@I knew it! Hey... what about your old henchman? Who was that guy?@Henchman
Marceline@Oh, just an old diving buddy. So, you ready to go strangle some pixies?@Henchman
Finn@Yeah, man! I mean, wo-man.@Henchman
Jake@Oh, no! My buddy is totally under her vampire spell! Die, unholy thing!@Henchman
Finn@Jake?@Henchman
Marceline@Ow!@Henchman
Finn@Marceline!@Henchman
Jake@I'm stakin' that vampire and settin' you free, no matter how terrified I am!@Henchman
Finn@She's alright, man!@Henchman
Jake@She's still controlling your mind with evil! Now, back off and let me vanquish her from existence!@Henchman
Finn@I can't let you do that, Jake!@Henchman
Jake@I love you, brother. YAAAH!@Henchman
Finn@Jake, listen! Marceline is not how she seems! She's a radical dame who likes to play games!@Henchman
Jake@What are you even talkin' about, dude?!@Henchman
Finn@Oh, man!@Henchman
Jake@MARCELINE! Where is she?!@Henchman
Finn@I-I'm free! Jake! You faced your fear and saved me!@Henchman
Jake@I did?! I did! Yeah! I saved my bro from a scum-sucking vampire!!@Henchman
Marceline@Is it cool?@Henchman
Finn@Yup!@Henchman
Marceline@Finn, I owe you big-time! Changing into a bat and hiding in your pack was genius!@Henchman
Finn@That's what henchmen are for.@Henchman
Marceline@Oh, uh, that reminds me. You're fired from your henchman-ship. It's no fun when I can't trick you.@Henchman
Finn@We're still on for pixie-strangling tomorrow, though, right?@Henchman
Marceline@Definitely.@Henchman
Finn@Ahhh... YEAH!!!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Heh heh. Aw, yeah.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Jake, get ready for a slap in the jowls. Seriously, though... get ready... for a day filled with adventure!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Whoa, really?!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Yeah, man!! I wrote on my arm this to-do list of cool junk. Number one back flip off this bridge and do the splits. Number two track down and slay a goblin horde. Number three... storm clouds?@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Hmmm... Finn... it's a knife storm!! It's raining knives, man! Come on!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@I've never seen a knife storm before... It's beautiful.@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Looks like we're stayin' in today, kid.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Well, what're we gonna do?@Rainy Day Daydream
BMO@Who wants to play video games??@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn and Jake@BMO!!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@What's on the menu, BMO?@Rainy Day Daydream
BMO@I've created a new game called Conversation Parade.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Hah! Alright!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Start it up, BMO!@Rainy Day Daydream
BMO@What do you think about the stars in the sky?@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@'S okay, I guess.@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Yeah, they're cool.@Rainy Day Daydream
BMO@That is an interesting response! Battery low... Shut doooowwwwn...@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Booooo.@Rainy Day Daydream

Finn@What now?@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Ooh, ooh! Dude, I know somethin' totally rockin' we can do!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Whoa! What?!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Let's use our imaginations, man!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Barf that! Imagination is for turbo nerds who can't handle how kick-butt reality is! I'm a kick-butt reality master!! I would rather die than be imaginative. I mean that.@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Eh. Your loss. AAAH!!! Lava!! Lava all around us!! Lava on the floor!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Shut up, man...@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Seriously, man! There must be an enchantment on the house or somethin'!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@I'm not playing you child-style games, guy. Watch and learn as I master... reality.@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@NOOOOO!!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@AAAAH!!! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Jake! What the hey-hey?!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@I was just playin' around with my imagination... ...and then everything got intense.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@It's like... whatever you imagine becomes real... That's bananas!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Don't imagine blowin' apart my own brain... Don't imagine my eyeballs coming alive and flying around with rocket packs...@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Dude! Imagine that BMO invented a better video game, and that he has new batteries.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn and Jake@WHOA!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@But first stop imagining lava!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@I can't! My imagination's too amazing!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Imagine turning your imagination off!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@I can't, dude... but I think I can imagine an imagination turning-off machine... that is upstairs, surrounded by a crud-load of traps, ghosts, monsters, and poison fountains, and... and... girls. Cute girls, and hamsters.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Can't you make it easier to get to that machine?@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@You can't hold this baby back! That's bad parenting, mamma!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Then it's up to me to take your imagination downtown! Let's go to the den and suit up!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Neat! Grab that missile.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Okay.@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@And... get that cosmic gauntlet.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Nah. There's a better one over by the desk. Ah! UNH! What did I just hit?!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@I'm imagining a wall. You can just go around it.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Really? That's it? There isn't any invisible, angry troll or anything?@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Oh, there's one now. Look out!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Aah! I can feel it on my foot! I'll kill you, troll! Yah! Yah! Yah, yah, yah, yah!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@You're kickin' too high! He's shorter than you!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Yah, yah!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Alright! You're gettin' him, man! Uh-oh. Now you're uppercutting his family. Heh heh heh heh heh! You just kicked his wife in the face! She's comin' back for revenge.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Cram this! We gotta book it to your imagination machine! Yah!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@The knife storm, remember?!?! Oh, boy... Ooh... Finn, I found some candy. It tastes like banana candy, man. Here, man. Try some.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Okay. Try to imagine some kind of steel umbrella over the bridge so... we don't get knifed.@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Okay! It is done.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Haha! Ha! Hey, you did it, man!@Rainy Day Daydream
Riddle Master@No, voyagers. To pass this bridge, you must first pass the test of the riddle.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@An imaginary riddle master?@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Ask me your riddle, Riddle Master. I accept your test.@Rainy Day Daydream
Riddle Master@Then brace yourself, fool, for this riddle comes from a mysterious, far-away land.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@LAY IT ON ME!!@Rainy Day Daydream
Riddle Master@Yes, um... The riddle, uh... It... cometh... uh...@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@I can't imagine a riddle.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Dude, just make it super easy.@Rainy Day Daydream
Riddle Master@THE RIDDLE COMETH! Tell me, voyager. What is simple, and yet also... a riddle?@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Man, that riddle sucks.@Rainy Day Daydream
Riddle Master@THAT IS THE WRONG ANSWER!! The penalty is... DEATH BY SNAKES!!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@YEAH, RIGHT! I'VE GOT A MISSILE!!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@You exploded the snakes right at us!!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@I can feel them all over my face! Imaginary poison coursing through my veins!!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@I'm sorry, brother! I'm so sorry!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Let's just get to your imagination machine and we'll be okay!!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@AAH! A big bowl of baby elephants, chainsaws, and doo-doo's flyin' towards us!! JUMP, DUDE!! Here come's a soul-eater! Snap its neck! The Bazooka Goblin has you in its sights!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Hey! Don't shoot us with that bazooka!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Don't you do it...@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@DON'T DO IT, MAN!!!@Rainy Day Daydream
Bazooka Goblin@Hee... heehee... hee... Okay.@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@YEAH!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@AW, YEAH!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Alright, use your powers or something. This poison is about to kill me.@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Alright. Goin' up. Check it. My imagination-off machine is left of the bed.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Is it clear?@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Yeah, I mean there's a bunch of cute girls... but they shouldn't bother you.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Oh! I found the shut-off lever!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Cool, man! Dang, girl. If you weren't a figment of my imagination, I'd want to have your baby. What're you laughin' at?@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Alright. I'm gonna turn it off. UNH!! You said it was clear of danger!!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Dude... I can't see anything... I must've imagined... an invisible monster!!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@What?! Well, how do I kill it?!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@I'm comin', buddy! Alright, Invisibo. Eat a piece of this! Hurry, Finn! Get to the lever!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Okay! I'm doin' iiiit!! Aw, yeah! The imaginary poison is gone, Jake! Jake? Hey, come on. Wake up, man.@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Hello, Finn. I am awake and healthy.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Jake... what happened to your bombastic personality?@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@I do not know what you mean. I am perfectly bombastic.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Nah, man, nah. Somethin's wrong. Tell me something amazing!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@But Finn, I cannot tell you something amazing as there is nothing amazing happening around us that I could describe for you.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Ah, see, man, you suck now! Crap, it's your imagination. You need that thing.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Jake... Stop it, man. You're just playing one continuous note.@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@One note is all that is needed.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@I'm gonna turn your imagination back on. Jake! Your imagination on-off switch has vanished!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@True. Doth thou not remember shutting down mine imagination?@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@I remembereth.@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@I am happy that my imagination is gone. It was purposeless.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@No! It was the opposite of that stuff. I know this now... ...only too late. Okay, man. I'm gonna try to imagine an imagination back-on switch for you, and so you know, if there's anything dainty inside my imagination, I'm gonna be mad. Imagination... go... What the stuff? Well... this isn't so bad. Nothing lame, at least. Hey! And there's Jake's imagination switch!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Cram. Oh! Maybe I can try imagining something. Now for that switch.@Rainy Day Daydream
Bellamy Bug@Good morrow, sir! My name is Bellamy Bug! Would you care for a crotchet doily my daughter made? She imbued it with her tears. You see, she recently broke up with a gentle dandy.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@No! How'd you get in my Imagination Land?!@Rainy Day Daydream
Bellamy Bug@I don't know, my young fellow! You tell me. Perhaps I represent your secret desire to be civilized!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@REPRESENT THIS! And this.@Rainy Day Daydream
Bellamy@Oh! I say! Oh! Ah! Ouch! Ah!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Haha... Penguins... Hahahaha! Heh, alright. I hope this works, Jake! Haha, yeah! Hey! Get away from that! Don't push that hyper drive button!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Aaaah!! I can imagine EVERYTHING!!!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Take a hike, fairy! Normal style! @Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Aw, man... I imagined my mom naked! Yugh!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@You okay?@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@I think so. Lemme check. Mmmm... Yup. She's clothed now. And hey, man! It's clear out now! We can go on an adventure!@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@I don't know, dude. I think we got all the adventure we need right here... with... lava on the floor!@Rainy Day Daydream
Jake@Huh?! AAH! AAH! MY LEGS ARE MELTING! Just kidding.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Hahahaha! Good dog.@Rainy Day Daydream
Finn@Our secret mission to capture the Ice King is underway. Though I probably shouldn’t say stuff like that out loud.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Who is it? Zap zap zap zap zap zap zap! Ooh, someone left me a gift. Peanut brittle? But I'm on a diet.@What Have You Done?
Jake@Should have stuck to your diet!@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Oahh! Finn, you have destroyed my faith in canned peanut brittle! Zap! Oh, no, my crown has all my powers in it!@What Have You Done?
Finn@Wrap attack!@What Have You Done?
Jake@How about I swaddle you up like a sweet baby.@What Have You Done?
Finn@We finally captured the Ice King!@What Have You Done?
Jake@Why'd we do this again?@What Have You Done?
Finn@Princess explained it all when she sent us on the mission, remember?@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@Go capture the Ice King, and bring him to me.@What Have You Done?
Jake@Hmm... That didn't really explain anything.@What Have You Done?
Finn@I'm sure she's got a good reason.@What Have You Done?
Finn@Where is everybody?@What Have You Done?
Jake@Yeah, this place is deserted, except for that guy.@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@Ich bin hier, Finn. ("I'm in here, Finn.")@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@It's me, the princess. Did you bring him?@What Have You Done?
Finn@Sure did.@What Have You Done?
Finn@So, what did the Ice King do to--@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@Ah-bababap! No time! Now quickly, with me!@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@Ttubllaw!@What Have You Done?
Stonesy@What's the password?@What Have You Done?
Stonesy@Oh, you got me!@What Have You Done?
Finn & Jake@Secret door!@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@This stairway leads to the dungeon where we'll toss that lousy Ice King!@What Have You Done?
Finn@What awful thing did he do to get tossed in there?@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@Chhh, he didn't do anything. Not a thing.@What Have You Done?
Finn@Wha?@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@It's a long story, Finn. You see, the Ice King...@What Have You Done?
Manfried@Princess Bubblegum, you're needed at once in the Grand Hall.@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@No! I need more time!@What Have You Done?
Manfried@Gosh, I'm sorry.@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@Alright, alright, I have to go. You two just guard the Ice King until I return and be prepared to make him howl with pain.@What Have You Done?
Finn@You got it, princess!@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Oh, this is a total rook!@What Have You Done?
Jake@Settle down, prisoner! We gotta record your belongings. One magical crown, probably stolen.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@I didn't steal it! I made that item! ...Made it with the magic that I stole! So hand it over, or I'll strike menacing poses at you!@What Have You Done?
Finn@Cool it, inmate!@What Have You Done?
Ice King@These bars can't hold me forever! Hey there's only like two of 'em. You fools have no business guarding prisoners.@What Have You Done?
Finn@Oh, yeah?! Well how 'bout these helmets we found? And we got the Oculus of Rehabilitation!@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Hmm?@What Have You Done?
Oculus@Be better!@What Have You Done?
Finn@And the shelf of penitence!@What Have You Done?
Ice King's crown@I'm sorry...I'm so sorry...@What Have You Done?
Ice King@How about you just hand me my crown. I'll create some ice bars.@What Have You Done?
Jake@Okay!@What Have You Done?
Finn@No, Jake! It's a trick.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@I'm toying with you, ha ha, psychologically.@What Have You Done?
Finn@Finished!@What Have You Done?
Ice King@So what am I being charged with?@What Have You Done?
Finn@Umm...@What Have You Done?
Jake@Five counts of jerkateering. Ha!@What Have You Done?
Finn@Yeah, what does it matter?@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Gah! Of course it matters! The way things work is first, I transgress your meaningless rules and then you maliciously persecute me!@What Have You Done?
Finn@That makes sense. You do bad stuff, we punish you.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Fool! You have disrupted that order, for--are you ready for this?--I have committed no recent crime!@What Have You Done?
Finn@Really? Umm...@What Have You Done?
Ice King@I'm rockin' your worldview!@What Have You Done?
Finn@Jake, he is starting to convince me we're doing a bad thing.@What Have You Done?
Jake@Dude, be calmed by my saliva and think of all the terrible things he's done.@What Have You Done?
Finn@Yeah... yeah! You're still a jerk that deserves to be in jail.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Oh, yeah? You know who really deserves to be in jail? I will show you the true jerks! Behold!@What Have You Done?
Finn@Uhh, it's too dark.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Behold! Wha, Behold! Behold the true jerks!@What Have You Done?
Finn@The jerks are us? Jake, am I going crazy? It seems like the Ice King is right about this. But if he's in the right, that means we're in...@What Have You Done?
Jake@The Candy Kingdom!@What Have You Done?
Finn@No, it means much, much worse.@What Have You Done?
Finn@On your feet.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Is it time for my hour in the yard, boss?@What Have You Done?
Finn@No, we're letting you go. We decided that it's wrong to imprison you.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@This is a trick, huh?@What Have You Done?
Finn@Get out of here before I change my mind!@What Have You Done?
Ice King@There must be someone waiting outside to beat me. Ooh, is that my crown over there?@What Have You Done?
Jake@I'm glad that's all taken care of.@What Have You Done?
Finn@No, quite yet.@What Have You Done?
Jake@Awww...@What Have You Done?
Finn@Sorry, but since we're the bad guys this time, we gotta go to jail.@What Have You Done?
Jake@This sucks.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Hey!@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Get out of my room!@What Have You Done?
Finn@You're still he-- ...Just get out out of here, man!@What Have You Done?
Ice King@So, you're really breaking me out?@What Have You Done?
Finn@Like I said, it's wrong to imprison you.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@You mean, you believe me? Oh, can it be? Has all the hatred between us transmuted into something more? A friendship? A best friendship. Knucks? Oh, ho ho, slaps in disgust, eh? Let's call them "Slappy D's"! Okay, see you later, my bosoms!@What Have You Done?
Finn@I am no man's bosom.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Cast "Detect Secret Door"! Success! Wa ha ha ha!@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@Sorry for the delay.@What Have You Done?
Jake@Man, there are a lot of secret door around here.@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@And now, Ice King, prepare to howl with pain?@What Have You Done?
Finn@Wow, she's so proud we did the right thing, she almost looks enraged.@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@Where is the Ice King?@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Finally! Freedom and friends FOREVER!!!@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@What have you done?!@What Have You Done?
Finn@What have we done?@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@I'll show you.@What Have You Done?
Finn@AHHH!!!@What Have You Done?
Starchie@Heah, even old Starchie's sick.@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@A plague of Freezer Burn Flu.@What Have You Done?
Finn@Ice King did this?@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@Well, yes and no.@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@It happened 3 days ago.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Hey, hey, Princess, check out my new trick! It's snowing it's snowing for you!@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@We don't think he was trying to spread disease, but soon the entire kingdom was infect by his beard flakes.@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@Through my research, I quickly discovered that the only way to cure my people was to obtain the pained howls of the Ice King himself.@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@But when I pleaded with him directly...@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@Please, I beseech your aid. In the name of common decency!@What Have You Done?
Ice King@So let me get this straight... You're hitting on me.@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@No!@What Have You Done?
Lady Rainicorn@으으, 웃기시네! 너는 우리 공주님과 판결 상대도 안 될 그런 가치없는 놈이야! ("Are you joking? You are not even worth my Lady's disdain.")@What Have You Done?
Ice King@I think I heard the word "Virile" in there. Oh, she is definitely hitting on me.@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@No!@What Have You Done?
Lady Rainicorn@말도 안 돼! ("No!")@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Be gone, you biddies!@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@He had his chance to help and he did nothing!@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Oh, my gosh, she came to me this time.@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@I had no choice but to try and take his wails by force.@What Have You Done?
Jake@By getting us to beat the tar out of him.@What Have You Done?
Finn@I can't just beat up the Ice King for nothing. That's against my alignment.@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@I know, I know. You're right.@What Have You Done?
Finn@But I'll get him to give up those howls. Voluntarily. I swear it.@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, thank you, Finn. I...@What Have You Done?
Finn@Shhhh...@What Have You Done?
Jake@Dude, how are we gonna get those howls?@What Have You Done?
Finn@Oh, I gotta plan to trick him, but you won't like it.@What Have You Done?
Jake@That sounds ominous. I don't like it!@What Have You Done?
Finn@Ice King, come forth!@What Have You Done?
Ice King@I'm coming forth! Hee hee, is that the voice of friendship I hear? So, are you fellas ready for game night?@What Have You Done?
Finn@Game night? Well, that's weird.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@What? Why?@What Have You Done?
Finn@You do know how friends act, right? You've had friends before.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@I... yes?@What Have You Done?
Finn@Yeah, so you know how friends are always howling in pain for each other.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Yeah... right! Everyone knows that!@What Have You Done?
Finn@Will you howl for me, pal?@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Oooh, of course, friend. Awoo-hehehehe! Oh, I've got the sillies! I couldn't possibly without giggling uncontrollably. I'm just so giddy about you being here! I'm a banana! Don't slip on me!@What Have You Done?
Jake@We're out of options. Let's just beat it out of him.@What Have You Done?
Finn@No, Jake! We...@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Wait a sec, there's a bug on you, friend. Smack!@What Have You Done?
Finn@Grrr... Biscuits, now's my chance!@What Have You Done?
Ice King@You know, I carved these game pieces from my own teeth.@What Have You Done?
Finn@Boo hoo, boo hoo, boo hoo, boo hoo...@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Huh? Crying?!@What Have You Done?
Finn@Boo hoo. You hit me, Ice King. I don't think I could live any more knowing my best bosom hit me.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@I was only saving you from poo poo palms!@What Have You Done?
Finn@I'm dying because I know you care not for me.@What Have You Done?
Ice King@No! No, my...my bosom! What hath I done?! My friend! My only friend.@What Have You Done?
Jake@Hey, what about me?@What Have You Done?
Ice King@Why?! Why?! WHY?!!!@What Have You Done?
Starchie@Starchie's feeling healthy again! A bit too healthy if you ask me.@What Have You Done?
Princess Bubblegum@They're all getting better! Finn and Jake did it! Ich bin so glücklich, ich koennte, ich koennte... ("I'm so happy, I could, I could...") @What Have You Done?
Ice King@WHY?!!!... Ah, well. Gunter! Dispose of Finn's carcass.@What Have You Done?
Finn@Harumph.@What Have You Done?
Jake@Good job! Those wails must have reached all the way to...@What Have You Done?
Finn@Did you see how fast he dropped my lifeless body? That's just mean.@What Have You Done?
Jake@Finn, if I came across your lifeless body, I'd clasp you dramatically for a kajillion years.@What Have You Done?
Finn@Thanks, man.@What Have You Done?
Jake@Hey, why wait?! Play dead, Finn!@What Have You Done?
Jake@Why?! Heh heh heh heh. Why?! Heh heh heh heh. Why?!@What Have You Done?
Finn & Jake@Adventure time!@What Have You Done?
Swamp Giant@AAAAH!@His Hero
Finn@Last chance, Swamp Giant! Tell us where you hid the Mini Queen!@His Hero
Swamp Giant@NEVER!!@His Hero
Finn@Huh? Hi, Mini Queen! Jake! I've got 'er!@His Hero
Jake@Then hold my hand, dude! Whoooop!@His Hero
Swamp Giant@Aaaah! Oof!@His Hero
Finn@My inflatable angel.@His Hero
Jake@Heh heh heh. How's the Mini Queen?@His Hero
Finn@I dunno. Can't understand a word she says. Aww! My pleasure, ma'am! I just like beating up evil! Okay... Didn't... catch any of that either.@His Hero
Jake@Mini Queen must've stepped in somethin' funky. No... It's not tiny feet I'm smelling! This way! Whoa!@His Hero
Finn@What?@His Hero
Jake@Do you know whose sword this is?! This is the sword of Billy!@His Hero
Finn@Billy?!@His Hero
Finn and Jake@BIIILLYYYYYY!!!@His Hero
Young Billy@Nothung!@His Hero
Finn@Oh, yeah! That was the most mathematical thing ever!@His Hero
Jake@Oh, yeah! Hahaha! He fought a bear!@His Hero
Finn@This is so cool!@His Hero
Finn and Jake@Whoa!@His Hero
Finn@It's Billy's legendary crack!@His Hero
Billy@Hello.@His Hero
Finn@It's him! It's him!!@His Hero
Jake@I know, I know! Be cool!!@His Hero
Billy@Yep. It's me.@His Hero
Finn@Man! I'm such a huge nerd for you! Please take us on as hero apprentices!@His Hero
Billy@What for?@His Hero
Finn@So that we could learn to kick evil's butt... just like you!@His Hero
Jake@I wanna be the dog version of you!@His Hero
Billy@Ahh, that'd be a waste of time.@His Hero
Jake@Heh. Yeah. I-I'm a little paunchy... but I could do some sit-ups!@His Hero
Billy@No, I was talking about beating up monsters. It's as pointless as a dog chasing his own tail.@His Hero
Jake@Heh. See, that's where you're wrong... 'cuz watch! Ah... ah...@His Hero
Finn@What do you mean, "pointless?" We just saved the Mini Queen from a monster!@His Hero
Billy@You know where she is right now? She's probably being eaten by a different monster. She's probably dead. In my youth, I was much like you. Motivated. Headstrong. Wore a silly, little outfit. Even had a magic dog.@His Hero
Jake@Heh... I'm gonna pass out...@His Hero
Billy@All my life, I've beaten on evil creatures. But new evil keeps popping up. Kicking their butts was a hopeless effort!@His Hero
Jake@What other way is there?@His Hero
Billy@Nonviolently. Help people by being active in your community.@His Hero
Finn@Nonviolently?? I gotta try being nonviolent... the Billy way...@His Hero
Jake@Me, too!@His Hero
Finn@Billy, I won't let you down!@His Hero
Jake@I love you, Billy! I got a secret crush on you, Billy!@His Hero
Finn@This is gonna be tough, Jake. I'll have to suppress my every warrior instinct.@His Hero
Jake@Relax. It'll be easy not to beat up on monsters and still help people.@His Hero
Cobbler@Help! Help! A monster! Oh! Thank goodness! Heroes! I'm being chased by a horrible Dragon! Please, please help!@His Hero
Finn@Oh, uh...@His Hero
Jake@Oh...@His Hero
Cobbler@Act quickly! He's almost upon us!@His Hero
Jake@Sorry. We don't beat stuff up anymore.@His Hero
Cobbler@No, but please!@His Hero
Finn@Dude. We gotta do something to help him.@His Hero
Jake@I could teach 'im how to not be such a spaz.@His Hero
Finn@Hey, Mister. Besides being chased by a monster, what else is wrong?@His Hero
Cobbler@Well... I've been running all day. I guess I'm pretty hungry.@His Hero
Jake@Say no more. Come on, Finn.@His Hero
Cobbler@Where're you going?!@His Hero
Jake@To make you somethin' to eat!@His Hero
Cobbler@AAAH!! NO!! HELP!!@His Hero
Finn@I still feel weird about not fighting off that dragon.@His Hero
Jake@Trust me. This is a way better way to help 'im. Gruel! Get your free gruel!@His Hero
Lady@What's this all about?@His Hero
Finn@Free gruel, ma'am. I can't beat monster butts, but I can beat your hungry guts. That's for sure!@His Hero
Lady@Hahaha! I didn't throw up! This gruel is very adequate.@His Hero
Finn@YEAH!!!@His Hero
Finn@This is great, Jake!@His Hero
Jake@Yeah, we're really helpin' people!@His Hero
Finn@Whoa! Look who it is!@His Hero
Jake@Dude! You're alive!@His Hero
Cobbler@No thanks to you two!! That dragon chased me for two days!! ...And then I was lost for... uh, three days... and then I... I fell under a spell of a beautiful enchantress for... a week? So that's two, plus three, plus a week—@His Hero
Jake@Dude. Gruel.@His Hero
Cobbler@Oh, thank you! Hahahaha! Hahaha. AAAH! WHAT'S HAPPENING?!@His Hero
Finn@Huh? Oh, that's probably the stone skin potion I added to the recipe. It gives your body the power to grow armor.@His Hero
Cobbler@Wha? Ah... uh?!@His Hero
Jake@Dude... how much of that potion did you use?@His Hero
Townsperson@AAAAH!! MY TUMMY IS BREATHING FIRE!!!@His Hero
Finn@Geez... I thought people would like that.@His Hero
Cobbler@Why?! Why would anyone want that?!@His Hero
Finn@So you can defend against evil monsters!@His Hero
Cobbler@You're supposed to beat up monsters so we don't have to defend ourselves!@His Hero
Finn@No, see? I'm helping you nonviolently!@His Hero
Cobbler@Helping?! I can't even move my hands! I'm a cobbler! How'm I supposed to cobble with these useless chunk mitts?!@His Hero
Finn@Sooo... the village needs the help of a new cobbler, eh?@His Hero
Finn and Jake@Hmmmmmm...@His Hero
Cobbler@WHAT?! NO—@His Hero
Finn@Alright! We're cobblers!@His Hero
Cobbler@No, you're not!! You're just watching my shop while I go to the dermatologist! And don't try to cobble anything!@His Hero
Jake@What does "cobble" mean, anyway?@His Hero
Finn@I think it has something to do with shoes...@His Hero
Fine Lady@Excuse me! Can you help me? I need a broken heel fixed. I'm going to a fancy funeral.@His Hero
Finn@Of course I'll help!@His Hero
Finn@There! Whah! Pa-kow!!@His Hero
Fine Lady@Ah!@His Hero
Finn@Now you can fight off evil if it shows up at the funeral!@His Hero
Jake@Did you fix that shoe with a magic nail?@His Hero
Finn@Maybe... Whoa!@His Hero
Jake@Cool!@His Hero
Fine Lady@I cannot go to the funeral in these!@His Hero
Cobbler@Hey, everyone! I'm back from the doctor! WHY?!@His Hero
Fine Lady@...And I'm not supposed to bring a guest.@His Hero
Cobbler@GET OUT!!@His Hero
Finn@Apparently, I suck at being nonviolent.@His Hero
Jake@Dude, suckin' at somethin' is the first step towards bein' sorta good at somethin'. You and I are like little baby Billys right now, and we're "sucking" on our first bottle of nonviolent milk!@His Hero
Finn@Totes. I'll stop "pooping" my diaper.@His Hero
Jake@Whoa, what?!@His Hero
Townsperson with fire-spitting belly button@HELP! I NEED MEDICAL HELP!!@His Hero
Finn@Medical help? Hmmmmm...@His Hero
Finn@How can we help?@His Hero
Lumpy Space Princess@I want surgery to make my body hot.@His Hero
Finn@Yikes...@His Hero
Lumpy Space Princess@Yeah. I know I'm already pretty smokin'... but I bought this swimsuit, so I need a swimsuit body.@His Hero
Jake@You up for some serious plastic surgery?@His Hero
Lumpy Space Princess@Aw, yeah! This body's hot! And powerful! Huh?! Aw, what?!@His Hero
Jake@Dude, did you use a magic nail again?@His Hero
Finn@I've got three left!@His Hero
Lumpy Space Princess@Ohhhh... What did you do to me??@His Hero
Finn@We transformed you into a cyborg fighter! That's hot, right?@His Hero
Lumpy Space Princess@No one thinks this look is hot!!@His Hero
Cobbler@Oh, my laces! You're the most beautiful—@His Hero
Lumpy Space Princess@Huh?!@His Hero
Finn@...Jake...?@His Hero
Jake@....Yeah...?@His Hero
Finn@I think us being nonviolent... is hurting people. Man... Billy is gonna be so bummed out...@His Hero
Jake@Not if we run away, Finn! We'll have to live in halfway homes and be cannibals! We'll survive!@His Hero
Finn@I just wanna sit here and moan.@His Hero
Jake@Then I'll moan with ya, buddy.@His Hero
Finn@Thaaaanks, buuuddy...@His Hero
Jake@Yoooouuu'rrre weeeelcooome...@His Hero
Old Lady@AAAH! AAAH! HELP ME!!@His Hero
Swamp Giant@Hahaha! Relax! I'm just gonna grind you up!!@His Hero
Old Lady@AAAH! AAAH!@His Hero
Jake@Aw, man, this grass-bag again?? HEY, EVIL-DOER! Um... could you keep your evil-doing quiet? Finn is dealing with some heavy stuff over here.@His Hero
Swamp Giant@It's not evil!! When they get this old, they wanna be ground up!! Hahaha! Right, you old bat?!@His Hero
Old Lady@Help!!@His Hero
Swamp Giant@Right?!?@His Hero
Old Lady@Oooh!! Aaah!!@His Hero
Finn@Huh?? A fist raised in righteous anger?! Oh, no! It's my fist!! I've gotta think of a way to save this old lady without punchin' this guy in the face!! Hmmm...@His Hero
Swamp Giant@Yeah, you wanna get ground up, right?!?@His Hero
Finn@WRONG!!!! I couldn't think of anything...@His Hero
Old Lady@Whooo!@His Hero
Finn@POOP!! I saved her with violence...@His Hero
Old Lady@What's your huff, son?@His Hero
Finn@The greatest hero in the world told me to help people without being violent... and I promised I would do that and not let him down... but I did let 'im down.@His Hero
Old Lady@Stuff and nonsense! You sure helped this old gal out! And you did it with violence! Like a true hero, you were born to punch evil creatures! Just like I was born to be an old lady! Don't deny your rowdy nature, paladins! And don't take advice from old people!@His Hero
Finn@Yeah... Yeah...! YEAH!! That old lady has a point!@His Hero
Jake@Wait, didn't she say not to take advice from old peo—@His Hero
Finn@It's all so clear to me! Back to the cave of Billy!!@His Hero
Jake@Cha!!@His Hero
Finn@It's us again.@His Hero
Jake@And we've got exciting news!@His Hero
Billy@Aw, I don't—I don't wanna buy anything.@His Hero
Finn@Billy, an old lady told me that I shouldn't listen to you because you're old. Also, that I should do what I was born to do... which is kickin' buns.@His Hero
Billy@Don't you see how pointless it is? You know what's probably happening to that old lady right now? She's probably dead!@His Hero
Jake@She's right here.@His Hero
Old Lady@Hello!@His Hero
Finn@We saved 'er, Billy.@His Hero
Jake@You saved 'er.@His Hero
Finn@I saved 'er, Billy. I saved 'er using violence. And that's not a bad thing, Billy! This old lady is alive because of these! And look how happy she is, man! She's elated!@His Hero
Billy@Hmm. Perhaps you're right. It's... it's as if your words are filling a void in my very being... You wanna watch? Nothung! Finn and Jake... truly, you are my heroes. Now you're freakin' me out...@His Hero
Jake@We're his heroes!!@His Hero
Billy@Huh... Hello.@His Hero
Jake@Ha! Haha! I love you, Billy!!@His Hero
Billy@Get outta here!!@His Hero
Finn@Jake! Jake! Jake? Hmmm...@Gut Grinder
Jake@Aaaah! Aaaaah! Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl! Uh! That sounded horrible, man!@Gut Grinder
Finn@I don't know how to play.@Gut Grinder
Jake@Exactly!@Gut Grinder
Finn@Huh? Let's go!@Gut Grinder
Jake@Oh, wait up. I gotta finish tuning my viola.@Gut Grinder
Finn@Soft People! Why are you all in a tizzy?@Gut Grinder
Soft Person #1@The Gut Grinder! He's back!@Gut Grinder
Finn@The "Gut Grinder?"@Gut Grinder
Old Soft Person@Yes, the Gut Grinder is a gold-eating monster. In the past, the Soft People of this village enjoyed piling our gold in the center of town and dancing wildly around it. It was awesome ! But then, the Gut Grinder came and stole our pile of gold. So we adapted and learned how to hide our gold using a big cup. And it worked! The Gut Grinder didn't come back! But recently, and admittedly it was probably a bad idea, we took our gold out from under the cup and we put it in the center of town. Haha, 'cause--'cause we really like dancing around it! But, boy oh boy, was that a mistake. You know what happened?@Gut Grinder
Finn@Uhhh... it came back and ate all your gold?@Gut Grinder
Old Soft Person@Yes, oh, yes!@Gut Grinder
Finn@Aw, don't cry, Soft Old Man. I'll find this monster and bring peace to this village. I swear!@Gut Grinder
Soft Person #1@Swear to what?@Gut Grinder
Finn@I swear to justice!@Gut Grinder
Soft People@Whoa! He swears to justice!@Gut Grinder
Finn@Okay, so, what does he look like?@Gut Grinder
Old Soft Person@Ohh, it's so scary we usually close our eyes and go wee-wee when he attacks. But... he left this footprint... Wha--?@Gut Grinder
Jake@Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!@Gut Grinder
Soft Person #1@Look! His paw matches the footprint!@Gut Grinder
Soft Person #1@I'm so scared, I'm gonna go wee-wee!@Gut Grinder
Finn@Whoa, no, no-no-no-no! Calm down, everybody. This is my friend, Jake the Dog.@Gut Grinder
Soft Person #2@Thank goodness.@Gut Grinder
Soft Person #1@Yeah--I almost wee-wee'd!@Gut Grinder
Jake@Wait, you were gonna wee-wee if I was the Gut Grinder?@Gut Grinder
Soft Person #1@Oh, yeah! We're terrified of him.@Gut Grinder
Jake@Then I am the Gut Grinder!@Gut Grinder
Soft Person #1@I'm gonna wee-wee!@Gut Grinder
Finn@That guy wee-wees weird.@Gut Grinder
Jake@I'm just kiddin', everybody. I'm not the Gut Grinder. I'm... Jake the Dog! Woohoo!@Gut Grinder
Soft Person #3@Aw, he's just a cute little dog!@Gut Grinder
Jake@Hey, I'm not cute!@Gut Grinder
Soft Child@Doggy! Pet, pet, pet!@Gut Grinder
Jake@Huh? Oh, heheh.@Gut Grinder
Finn@Pfft.@Gut Grinder
Jake@What?!@Gut Grinder
Finn@I didn't say anything. People of the village of Soft People, I, Finn, and my buddy Jake, will find this monstrous monster and slay it!@Gut Grinder
Finn@Come on, let's go, Jake.@Gut Grinder
Jake@Oh... heheh. What? No! Noooo...@Gut Grinder
Soft Child@Bye-bye, doggy!@Gut Grinder
Jake@Bye, Soft Village.@Gut Grinder
Jake@Hey Finn, my feet fit these prints pretty well. Hm, what if I really am the Gut Grinder?@Gut Grinder
Finn@Dude, your paws'll fit anything.@Gut Grinder
Jake@That is true. Check this out. I'm Finn the Human and I stink at viola!@Gut Grinder
Finn@I'm Jake the Dog and I put my nose in poop.@Gut Grinder
Jake@There's a lot of interesting smells in poop.@Gut Grinder
Finn@Huh?@Gut Grinder
Finn@Hey Cube People, what's going on here?@Gut Grinder
Cube Person #1@The Gut Grinder stormed into our village and ate all of our gold!@Gut Grinder
Jake@Wait, what happened?@Gut Grinder
Cube People@Aaah! The Gut Grinder!@Gut Grinder
Finn@Whoa, no, no, no! He's not the Gut Grinder! He's my friend!@Gut Grinder
Cube Person #2@We saw the Gut Grinder and he looks exactly like him!@Gut Grinder
Jake@Th-that's ridiculous.@Gut Grinder
Finn@Jake, back to your normal size.@Gut Grinder
Jake@Oh yeah. Ooh ooh ooh. I am not... the Gut Grinder. Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh.@Gut Grinder

Jake@Yeah, I-I know you think it does, Finn--but this is different. I'm scared, Finn.@Gut Grinder
Finn@Jake, stop it!@Gut Grinder
Spiky Mayor@Wha--? Oh, it's the Gut Grinder!@Gut Grinder

Finn@NOOOOOO!@Gut Grinder
Spiky Mayor@You are under arrest for stealing our gold.@Gut Grinder
Finn@I'll get you out of here... somehow.@Gut Grinder
Jake@No, Finn... I belong behind bars. Look at the evidence--I really am the Gut Grinder.@Gut Grinder
Finn@Buddy, listen to me. You've been my best friend for as long as I can remember! That's enough evidence to prove to me that you're not a monster!@Gut Grinder
Jake@Then... why am I in jail? Only Gut Grinders go to jail.@Gut Grinder
Old Man Prisoner@I'm in jail and I'm not the Gut Grinder. I'm here for the free grub. Hehehehehe!@Gut Grinder

Jake@Rawr! Now give me that tooth!@Gut Grinder
Finn@If I give you this stupid tooth, will you stop being a crazy jerk?!@Gut Grinder
Finn@What the--? Jake! You never turn into a monster when I want you to. It's always, "Not now, Finn. I have a headache." Oh, Jake, your viola is all I have now. @Gut Grinder
Jake@Huh? Ah, stay away from my viola!@Gut Grinder
Finn@Jake, you remember your viola!@Gut Grinder
Jake@I also remember that you stink hard at playing it. And dookie is radical, man! I don't care what anyone says. Wha--huh? What? Where am I? Finn, is that you?@Gut Grinder

Sharon@Yes, Cameron. I've been stealing gold.@Gut Grinder
Spiky Mayor@WHY, SHARON?!@Gut Grinder
Sharon@Because I like to buy things, Cameron! I like to shop! And I dressed up like Jake because I think he's hot.@Gut Grinder

Finn@You got it!@It Came from the Nightosphere
Marceline@Huh? Finn, you messed the beat up!@It Came from the Nightosphere
Finn@Marceline, if you're thinkin' about your dad so much, then... why don't you go see 'im?@It Came from the Nightosphere
Marceline@He's not worth the effort.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Finn@Not worth what effort?@It Came from the Nightosphere
Marceline@Well... first, I'd have to draw a circle with a happy face in the center and then... uh... douse it with bug milk.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Finn@Oh, yeah?!@It Came from the Nightosphere
Marceline@And then you're supposed to chant something like , "Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum." But... I-I don't really wanna see him. I'm still mad about the thing with the fries. Huh?!@It Came from the Nightosphere
Finn@Wwwwhhhat?! Whoa... whoa!! Aaagh!!@It Came from the Nightosphere
Lord of Evil@Marceline!@It Came from the Nightosphere

Finn@Oh...@It Came from the Nightosphere
Fluffy Person@Huh? Who the fluff are you?@It Came from the Nightosphere
Lord of Evil@Um... Well, I'm sure not the guy who's gonna suck out your soul.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Fluffy Person@Good 'cause that's, like, my number one fear.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Lord of Evil@Really!? Well... I know a little exercise for that! Wanna try??@It Came from the Nightosphere
Fluffy Person@Wow...@It Came from the Nightosphere

Fluffy Person@Yeah, I guess... So what?@It Came from the Nightosphere
Lord of Evil@So... This next part will be all the more... horrifying.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Finn@There!! Below us! A gathering of Fluffy People! May-haps they've seen your father! Marceline... release the Finn-bomb! They're all freaked out!@It Came from the Nightosphere
Marceline@It's because they're scared of him. Hm. My dad's been here. Come on. Let's go.@It Came from the Nightosphere

Marceline@Look. You wanna help him? Help me get my bass back.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Finn@How will that help hi—?@It Came from the Nightosphere
Marceline@MY DAD STOLE MY BASS GUITAR, FINN!! And when I get it back... I'm gonna break it over his neck and slam my dad back into the Nightosphere!@It Came from the Nightosphere
Finn@Oh, clam! But first you gotta return the souls your dad sucked back to these sad, little husks. Right, Marceline?@It Came from the Nightosphere
Marceline@Uh, sure, yeah, yeah, we'll do that.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Head Marauder@So I popped his head like a cork! And I says, "That's what I think of Expanding Earth Theory!"@It Came from the Nightosphere
Lord of Evil@Alright.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Marauders@Huh?!@It Came from the Nightosphere
Lord of Evil@I've got a joke, too. What wears a dark suit, is completely evil, and is about to suck out all your souls?@It Came from the Nightosphere
Head Marauder@Yo mama!@It Came from the Nightosphere
Lord of Evil@That's right! I'm your mama!@It Came from the Nightosphere
Marceline@Red Rock Pass. If my dad wants to get through the mountains, he'll have to come through here.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Finn@We can work together! And smash 'im with this rock! And once he's smooshed, all the souls will go back to their rightful bods.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Lord of Evil@So, finally taking a run at your old man, huh?@It Came from the Nightosphere

Marceline@I just want my dad to care about me.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Lord of Evil@Of all history's greatest monsters, you are by far the most evil thing I've encountered. Offer your soul to me, dark one.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Gunter@Wenk wenk.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Lord of Evil@NO! You can't have my soul! I don't even...! Look, just get in here.@It Came from the Nightosphere

Lord of Evil@I'm sorry I ate your fries. I didn't mean to hurt you.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Marceline@It's okay, Dad. It's... it's really okay.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Lord of Evil@No, it's not okay. They weren't even very good. They were really cold. I love you, Marceline. Don't you ever doubt that.@It Came from the Nightosphere
Marceline@I love you, too, Dad.@It Came from the Nightosphere

Finn@Then we went to LSP's quinceañera.@The Eyes
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, no way. You guys made it!@The Eyes

Jake@No.@The Eyes
Finn@I can't sleep either.@The Eyes
Jake@Yeah, what's going on with that?@The Eyes
Finn@I don't know. But, I've got the strangest feeling...that we're being watched.@The Eyes
Finn@Why is that horse staring at us?@The Eyes
Finn@That's super creepy.@The Eyes
Jake@Man, I just wanna go to sleep.@The Eyes
Finn@Well, maybe he's gone.@The Eyes
Jake@Not gonna be able to sleep with that horse watchin' me.@The Eyes

Jake@See 'ya in the morning, pal.@The Eyes
Finn@Ahh! Why won't it stop?!@The Eyes
Jake@All right, man. Let's just go...push it off that hill or something.@The Eyes
Finn@Maybe we can just...politely ask it to leave.@The Eyes
Jake@Hey! Get out of here, horse! I want to go to sleep, and you're creeping me the math out!@The Eyes
Finn@Whoa, man! Let me try, diplomat style. Pardon me horse, I beseech thou to split from mine land, this night. But I welcome thee to come back for some luncheth, some other day. Okay?@The Eyes
Jake@Forget it, man. This horse is whack. It's got poo-brain.@The Eyes
Finn@Okay, you're right. We can try pushing it, now.@The Eyes
Finn@Move, horsey! Good Grod, Jake! Are you even pulling?!@The Eyes
Jake@I'm super-pulling!@The Eyes
Finn@This horse has a ridiculous weight!@The Eyes
Finn@Math this. What now, man.@The Eyes
Jake@I didn't wanna have to use my powers on you, horse, because I'm so sleepy. But you've pushed Jake too far!@The Eyes
Giant Jake@RAAAAHH! AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!@The Eyes

Finn@Look, man.@The Eyes
Jake@Wh..why?! Stupid blindfold! What's your deal, screwy?! Why are you messin' with us, huh?!@The Eyes
Finn@Jake! That horse is whack with poo-brain.@The Eyes
Jake@Yeah, I know, Finn. I diagnosed this horse with whacked out poo-brain five minutes ago.@The Eyes
Finn@Dude, poo-brain means we can lure it away from here using music. Everything brainless likes music.@The Eyes
Jake@That's true! You're a genius! All right horse, prepare to be lured! Follow me, Horsey.@The Eyes
Finn@Jake? It's not luring!@The Eyes
Jake@Huh! Hmmm. So, Beethoven's not luring enough for you, is it? Well, how about some Mozart?! @The Eyes
Finn@Huh?!@The Eyes
Finn@Ha!@The Eyes

Finn@What?!@The Eyes
Jake@I'm so tired, Finn!@The Eyes
Finn@No, man, we're not killing the horse.@The Eyes

Finn@Wah?!@The Eyes
Jake@Caaawww! Caaawwwwww!@The Eyes
Finn@No, man! That is wrong.@The Eyes
Jake@Eh. Did I say that the hawk would kill him? I meant that the hawk would swoop down gently and take him away to an island of sunshine and love-stuff and, take care of him.@The Eyes
Finn@Whoa. That sounds awesome.@The Eyes
Jake@What do think?@The Eyes
Finn@It looks like a bunny?@The Eyes
Both@Hey Come and get it hawk, let's go!@The Eyes

Jake@Good night, buddy.@The Eyes
Finn@Ahh! It's in our house now!@The Eyes
Jake@That's obvious, Finn! You don't have to say that out loud!@The Eyes
Finn@Hey, this is all your fault, dude! If you weren't so darn handsome, animals wouldn't always be staring at you!@The Eyes
Jake@You're just mad at me for being...handsome? Well, you're the one who told me to lure snakes! Ahhh!@The Eyes
Finn@I told you to lure the horse! You lured the snakes! There's even one here in my underpants! Wait a minute, dude. Can't you see what this horse is doing? It's tearing us apart.@The Eyes
Jake@Aw, man.. you're right! We have to get rid of this horse, for us!@The Eyes
Finn@I know, bro. I know.@The Eyes
Jake@Oh, Finn; this horse is bringing us together now. This horse is a blessing.@The Eyes
Finn@What?! Dude, you've lost it!@The Eyes
Jake@You...wait, wait. The horse is tearing us apart again!@The Eyes
Finn@You're right! It's about time I show this horse who's the man.@The Eyes
Jake@What are you going to do?@The Eyes
Finn@Say that to me again.@The Eyes
Jake@What are you going to do?!@The Eyes
Finn@Do... Doo-doo. I'm going to kick that horse in the bottom!@The Eyes
Jake@Oh, my Grod!@The Eyes
Finn and Jake@The Ice King?!@The Eyes
Ice King@I should go.@The Eyes

Ice King@Ok, ok, I'll tell you! I was watching you... to learn how to be happy.@The Eyes
Finn@What?@The Eyes
Jake@Huh?@The Eyes
Ice King@It's true! I would like to be happy like you guys. But, I have no idea how.@The Eyes
Jake@So, you dressed up like a horse?@The Eyes
Ice King@Have pity on me. I've been so sad and miserable, I cry all the time. But, whenever I see you two, you always look so happy.@The Eyes
Ice King@But, they're just hopping over each other.@The Eyes
Ice King@So yes, I've decided to spy on you, dressed as a horse.@The Eyes
Ice King@But, I guess my plan failed. All I observed was you two arguing over...how to get rid of me.@The Eyes
Ice King@Hey, are you sleeping? Is this it? Sleeping? Could it be that all I need is a good night's rest?@The Eyes
Ice King@Ahh... I'm... still not happy.@The Eyes
Engagement Ring Princess@Save me, Finn and Jake.@Loyalty to the King
Jake@Shoosh@Loyalty to the King
Engagement Ring Princess@Save me, Finn and Jake.@Loyalty to the King

Finn@Tree Trunks, you've gone bananas with crystal power!@Crystals Have Power
Tree Trunks@Finn, it's not sexy for a king to call his queen bananas!@Crystals Have Power
Finn@Jake, you totally gotta stop her!@Crystals Have Power
Jake@I'll try man, but I'm still figuring out my bizz, here I come, Tree Trunks! Taste my gentle rubs!@Crystals Have Power
Tree Trunks@Whoa there, don't you put your junk on my trunk!@Crystals Have Power
Finn@Go, Jake, go!@Crystals Have Power
Jake@She's too sassy and powerful!@Crystals Have Power
Joshua@Jake, Jake, I brought someone here to see you, it's your brother.@Crystals Have Power
Jake@Jermaine?! Are you dead?@Crystals Have Power
Jermaine@Nah man, we're just dreamin' at the same time.@Crystals Have Power
Jake@Oh, I'm sorry about that time I beat you up.@Crystals Have Power
Jermaine@That was an accident, I knew you were just horsin' off!@Crystals Have Power
Jake@But dad, you said I was going to hurt everybody!@Crystals Have Power
Joshua@Yeah, every-bod-y.@Crystals Have Power
Jake@I don't know, dad, that doesn't really help me.@Crystals Have Power
Joshua@Everybody who is evil, Jake. Let me finish next time, hm, yeah?@Crystals Have Power
Jake@Oh, well then I'm over it then! Rarr@Crystals Have Power
Finn@Jake, kick Tree Trunks in the tummy, shes probably still got that crystal gem inside her!@Crystals Have Power

Tree Trunks@Marry me, Finn, we can snuggle through time and space and kiss each other in an alternate dimensional place.@Crystals Have Power
Tree Trunks@Oh, dear.@Crystals Have Power
Jake@TT, you're back.@Crystals Have Power
Tree Trunks@Oh, Jake, I was behaving so inappropriately I'm so embarrassed.@Crystals Have Power
Jake@Oh shush, Tree Trunks, if I had a penny for every time someone went crazy hopped up on magic energy... I'd be Abraham Lincoln!@Crystals Have Power
Finn@Tree Trunks, you're okay!@Crystals Have Power
Jake & Tree Trunks@Finn!@Crystals Have Power
Finn@I'm okay toooo!@Crystals Have Power
Tree Trunks@Oh, Finn, I was trapped here for so long and all I could think about was you and how your so nice to me and I, and I just wanted to say... I think... you're cute and I like you.@Crystals Have Power
Finn@Okay, okay, let's go.@Crystals Have Power
Tree Trunks@Finn, when we get home, it's apple pie time.@Crystals Have Power
Finn@Ooooh!!@Crystals Have Power
Tree Trunks@♪Apple pie in the oven, Tell me you can taste lovin'♪@Crystals Have Power
Princess Bubblegum@In the Kingdom of Ooo there is a galaxy of flavors, but only one taste sensation is amazing enough to kill for—the Royal tart. Royal tarts are very rare. They are only eaten at the most sacred gathering in Ooo—the annual Back-Rubbing Ceremony . The tart is so legendary that countless thieves will risk their lives for just one bite.@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@My head will be decapitated if the tarts don't make it to the ceremony. I only trust one guy to deliver them... the Royal Tart Toter.@The Other Tarts
Finn and Jake@Whoa!@The Other Tarts
Jake@He's magnificent!@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@He used to be, but he's gone mad and old. So he can't deliver the tarts anymore. Cinnamon Bun offered to fill the position, but he's kind of... half-baked.@The Other Tarts
Cinnamon Bun@Hey Princess! Here I go! I'm stuck.@The Other Tarts
Finn@Princess, let us deliver the tarts.@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@Are you sure Finn? This is really important.@The Other Tarts
Finn@Princess, I have never been more sure of anything in my whole life! I'll do anything it takes to keep you alive and safe. We won't let you down.@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@Well... I accept your offer.@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@Welcome to the Tartorium!@The Other Tarts
Finn@Wow. They're so beautiful.@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@No, boys. Those are the reject tarts, full of imperfections. These are the perfect tarts... safely packed into one of my anti-gravity tote chambers.@The Other Tarts
Finn and Jake@Tote sweet!@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@Now, I want you to tote those tarts through that tunnel. The Royal Tart Path takes you directly to the Royal Congressional Hall in the Bad Lands. The path is really safe and well protected, but keep your eyes open for any sign of danger, okay?@The Other Tarts
Finn@Mmm hmm.@The Other Tarts
Jake@Yep.@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@Good. Now here's your map.@The Other Tarts
Finn@Hey Princess, what are all these bubbling chemicals all over the place?@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@That's paralyzing potion, Finn! Don't touch it. It'll paralyze you forever!@The Other Tarts
Finn@Oh.@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@Thank you, boys. And remember, my head is on the line!@The Other Tarts
Jake@All right, let's hit it.@The Other Tarts
Finn@Wait. I got a sick plan!@The Other Tarts
Finn@Go!@The Other Tarts
Cinnamon Bun@Okay. Bye! Bye-bye! Bye-bye! Bye!@The Other Tarts
Finn@Goodbye! You'll be fine! Hahaha!@The Other Tarts
Jake@Bye! Goodbye!@The Other Tarts
Jake@Heh, that was fun, but why'd you do it?@The Other Tarts
Finn@Look, everyone expects the tarts to on that Royal Tart Path. Cinnamon Bun will be our decoy while we take the one path no thief expect a tart toter to take the Desert of Doom!@The Other Tarts
Jake@I guess this is it.@The Other Tarts
Finn@Huh, not as scary as I thought it'd be.@The Other Tarts
Jake@Yeah, man, mostly just looks empty. I mean, what thief would ever hang out here? There's nothing to steal!@The Other Tarts
Finn@You know, I think my plan might be kinda brilliant. I mean, I'm not saying I'm the brilliant, but it's a pretty brilliant plan, I think.@The Other Tarts
Jake@True, true. This place is perfect for toting tarts.@The Other Tarts
Finn@Yeah, and the Back-Rubbing Ceremony is right over those mountains. This tart tote is gonna be a total tart walk.@The Other Tarts
Jake@Heheheh, yeah. Ohh, wait! Hold up!@The Other Tarts
Finn@What is it?@The Other Tarts
Jake@Shh. It's a campfire—close by.@The Other Tarts
Finn@Does it smell like a tart thief's campfire?@The Other Tarts
Jake@Maybe.@The Other Tarts
Finn@Better check it out—can't be too careful.@The Other Tarts
Taddle@D-d-don't burn it now, Grimby.@The Other Tarts
Grimby@Hush. I ain't gon' burn it.@The Other Tarts
Finn@Crud! I was sure we'd be safe in the Desert of Doom!@The Other Tarts
Jake@What? Whatcha sayin'?@The Other Tarts
Finn@Those are dirty tart burglers!@The Other Tarts
Jake@I think they're just dirty hobos.@The Other Tarts
Finn@No, man, they are cold-blooded tart destroyers and we have to get them before they get us.@The Other Tarts
Jake@Why?@The Other Tarts
Finn@They're gonna kill Princess Bubblegum by stealin' our tarts!@The Other Tarts
Jake@Oh, yeah.@The Other Tarts
Taddle@But how come JJ gets to hold it, Grimby?@The Other Tarts
Jake@Rawr!@The Other Tarts
Finn@Yeah, go on, get! We'll mash you up crazy! You! Listen up and tell your friends the next time you wanna steal one of our tarts—!@The Other Tarts
Grimby@You got tarts?@The Other Tarts
Finn@You know we do! And the next time you want to steal one—! You picture this guy right here chewin' on your brain! What the—?! That thing's gettin' the tarts!@The Other Tarts
Finn@Son of a—.@The Other Tarts
Taddle and Grimby@We eatin' good tonight!@The Other Tarts
Jake@Uh-oh, man, he got, like, five or six!@The Other Tarts
Finn@But... my brilliant plan.@The Other Tarts

Finn@What the—?@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@Hey, Finn.@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@I'm just checking in using the holo-pendant. How are my tarts doing?@The Other Tarts
Finn@They're, um... th-they're—@The Other Tarts
Jake@They're radical! No tart problems here!@The Other Tarts
Finn@Uhh, yeah! Right! Everything's, uh—bazoobs! Oh, look, something is eclipsing the sun. It's so dark now.@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@Finn? Finn! Oh, well, I'll see you soon enough!@The Other Tarts
Holo-Pendant@Transmission complete.@The Other Tarts
Jake@I think the plan went awry.@The Other Tarts
Finn@No! All this was just some freak bad luck, but we still got some tarts and the princess is still safe.@The Other Tarts
Jake@Oh, yeah, and who knows what kind of freaky things would have happened if we took the Royal Tart Path? Heheh, old Cinnamon Bun's probably got his hands full.@The Other Tarts
Cinnamon Bun@Bye! Goodbye! Bye-bye!@The Other Tarts

Royal Tart Path Guard 8@Shall I hold that for you, sir?@The Other Tarts
Royal Tart Path Guard 7@Okay.@The Other Tarts
Finn@You know what? Even though it totally wasn't our fault, it's probably for the best that we lost those tarts.@The Other Tarts
Jake@Huh? How?@The Other Tarts
Finn@Well, it's like a reminder to really stay sharp and play it extra safe.@The Other Tarts
Finn@For instance, take this scary cavern, here. No sane person would ever bring a tart down there. So...@The Other Tarts
Jake@So no thieves!@The Other Tarts
Finn@Exactly.@The Other Tarts
Jake@You are on a roll today, buddy!@The Other Tarts
Finn@P.U.!@The Other Tarts

Finn@You really think so?@The Other Tarts
Jake@Yeah, why not?@The Other Tarts
Butterfly@Hey! Keep off them tarts!@The Other Tarts

Butterfly Bandit@I said back off of them tarts! Are you an imbecile?!@The Other Tarts

Princess Bubblegum@Okay! Jeez, Finn, I won't eat that tart. I'll eat this other tart instead!@The Other Tarts
Finn@No, Princess, no!@The Other Tarts
Finn@The princess has been paralyzed!@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@I'm not paralyzed! I'm gripped with the flavor!@The Other Tarts
Finn@That means we must have been carrying the poisoned tarts all along!@The Other Tarts
Finn@Yep! All part of my master plan.@The Other Tarts
Jake@Psht! Whatever, man. Heh heh.@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@Excuse me! What is this about poisoned tarts and alternate plans?@The Other Tarts
Finn@I-I—alright, here it comes. I had a brilliant plan to tote the tarts along a dangerous path, but I mucked it up. You oughtta give this toter job to Cinnamon Bun. He's the real hero.@The Other Tarts
Cinnamon Bun@Yeah!@The Other Tarts
Finn@I'm sorry for not following your instructions and for lying to you about it.@The Other Tarts
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, Finn, I forgive you—'cause I lied to you, too! They weren't going to decapitate me; I just said that so you guys wouldn't eat the tarts!@The Other Tarts

Princess Bubblegum@The old Tart Toter! Nobody move! He can't see or hear, but he can feel your movement.@The Other Tarts
Royal Tart Toter@Hello? Eat my tarts? This cosmic dance of bursting decadence and withheld permissions twists all our arms collectively, but if sweetness can win—and it can— then I'll still be here tomorrow, to high-five you yesterday, my friends. Peace.@The Other Tarts
Finn@Sheesh!@The Other Tarts
Finn@Blah-la-luh. Hey, Jake, give me some of that apple.@To Cut a Woman's Hair

Tree Witch@Hmm.@To Cut a Woman's Hair
Finn@Look, Lady, we can't help you get princess hair.@To Cut a Woman's Hair

Jake@Duuuude!@To Cut a Woman's Hair
Finn@No one will ever find you beautiful. everrr! And it's got nothing to do with the ol' chrome dome. It has to do with what's in here. Can you get off my friend now?@To Cut a Woman's Hair

Finn@Gee... I feel kind of bad.@To Cut a Woman's Hair
Jake@I don't.@To Cut a Woman's Hair
Finn@Hey, witch! Does it have to be princess hair?@To Cut a Woman's Hair
Tree Witch@No. Just beautiful hair.@To Cut a Woman's Hair
Finn@Well then, check this out! HA HA-A-A-A-A-A!!!@To Cut a Woman's Hair
Tree Witch@You'd really give me your hair?@To Cut a Woman's Hair
Finn@Sure!@To Cut a Woman's Hair
Tree Witch@So... how do I look?@To Cut a Woman's Hair
Finn@Totally beautiful. inside and out!@To Cut a Woman's Hair
Tree Witch@Thank you, Finn. And now to use my hair for evil.@To Cut a Woman's Hair
Finn@What?!@To Cut a Woman's Hair
Tree Witch@'Cause I'm evil!! What did you want from me? Ohh -- Oh, no. I think I fractured a branch.@To Cut a Woman's Hair
Finn@Hour ​​six of our Ice Kingdom stakeout. Abso-nothing's going on there.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@And if I do this hand position, my boogers should turn into smoke bombs.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Pfff. You sure this tip is good, Flambo?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Fambo@Come on, you know I'm on the level. The Ice King is scheming to nabs a princess today. I swears it.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Hmm.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Relax, Restless Pants. A true ninja can sense the intentions of his enemies. Jin.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Flambo@Ninjas? Ninjas ain't real for nothing, no how.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Whoa, now—ninjas are real. For you see, Doo, doo, doo... Jake and I are ninjas.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Yep, ever since we fished this ninja manual out of a ditch. Finn, booty me!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Listen!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Finn, I think I'm gonna take off my booties. I can't flip these pages.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Gunter, let's go! I've got the overnight bag.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Gunter@Wenk, wenk!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@It's the Ice King, all right, and he's looking awful pleased with himself.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Uh-oh. If the Ice King's so happy, he must have stolen a princess when we weren't looking, somehow. That's ninja logic.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Then we gotta...@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Flambo@Ahem.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@...we gotta save that princess.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@You got it, shino-bro! Ninja kick!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Ninja kick!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Princess? Princess!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Princess?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Princess!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Princess? ...Ahh...@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@No princess here, man.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@No princess? It's... a trap! We're being trapped! Ninja vanish! Evade! Evade!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Nothing is trapped, dude. We can't find any captured princesses, because the Ice King hasn't captured one yet. He's out doin' it right now.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Are you sure?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@No. It's only a ninja hunch, so we should ninja snoop for proof.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Wait, man. I-I feel uncomfortable snooping through Ice King's personal stuff. It feels sorta like... a violation.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Whoo! Got the Ice King's diary.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@No, no, no, no, no! We can't read his private junk!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@And yet we must. Dear diary—and you better write me back this time!— today I'm bringing home a special new cutie.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@There's our proof, man! ... Hmm, alright. Let's use our ninja stealth and hide until he comes back with the princess.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Or... we could keep looking through his stuff. Heh, heh, heh! You know, for more proof? Hehehe!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@No. Alls we're gonna do is lie in wait until the Ice King gets back. Then—BOOM —we catch him with princess on his hands.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Where are we gonna hide?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@In this filthy hamper! Think he's there yet?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@See anything?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Nah. Hey, Finn, I don't want to hide in the hamper anymore; it reeks in here.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@But we're ninjas! And this is our ninja hideout.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Nah, man. My sense of smell is, like, one thousand times better than yours. Also, the hamper's boring. I'm out.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Wait!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@I'm out!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Jake! Get back here! Hey, wait up!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Check this out!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Weird.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@I want to draw something.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Hey! We gotta leave no trace! Ninjas leave no trace!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@I'll delete it after!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Hey, come on!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Jake, what have we done?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Both@A secret hidden room full of ninja stuff!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Oh, great—a line. Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Rock Man@Uhh, I-I think you were actually ahead of me.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@You know I was. Counter maid, I demand medical attentions, preferably those of a princessy type.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Rock Nurse@And are you checking in as a patient or a cadaver?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Hey! I'm as healthy as ten old men!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Ah! Oh, oh, right! My penguin—he's very, very sick. So... what time does your shift end?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@What kind of guy builds a cave inside of another a cave? What's this? A spellbook? Whoo!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Dude! Leave no trace!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Ah, it's too late for that.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@It's not too ...late. WHOA!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@What'cha got there?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Dude! It's a first-edition Ice Ninja Manual!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@A true ninja passes no wind; he only passes...@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@I ain't even heard of these techniques. Ee-oy-nee-noy-ee-oy-nee-noy-numb-chucks!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Hey. Ice King seems way into ninjas, even more than we are.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Yeah, so?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@So... doesn't that mean that ninjas must be... kinda lame?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Nah, they're still cool. But Ice King's still lame because he hides his ninja love. We wear our ninja on our sleeves!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Jake! Show me how to do that.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@What's taking that doctor so long? Gunter, make more noise!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Gunter@WUAH! WUAH!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Yeah, alright. Don't oversell it, drama queen.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Dr. Princess@Dun, dun, dunnn. Pardon the intrusion. I'm Doctor Princess.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Yes, well, uh... Come to Ice King, Princess.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Dr. Princess@Don't worry, sir. I specialize in treating little tuxedo people.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Just give it to me straight, doc. Am I gonna have to pay for this?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Dr. Princess@Hmm...@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Gunter@Wenk-wenk. Wenk-wenk. Wenk-wenk.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Dr. Princess@Oh, my!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@What can you do for him, Doctor Princess? Without Gunter, I'll be all alone. You see, I'm a widower.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Dr. Princess@Oh, I'm sorry. How did your wife die?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Oh, what? Is that what that means?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Dr. Princess@Whoa, Nelly! Something medical is happening!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Gunter, you're embarrassing me!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Fridjitsu master Finn summons... dagger of chilled glass.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Fridjitsu master Jake summons... stars of frozen rain. Get ready to be... star struck.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Get ready to be... cold cut!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Hyah!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Kunai attack!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Icicle kick!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Force of blizzard!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Flying jump!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@What?! Three Jakes? That's one too many. Caltrop hailstorm! Those Jakes were all fakes!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Heh! Fridjitsu master Jake summons... arrow of ice!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Hiyah! Rad.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Both@WOOHOO! YEAH!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@It's the Ice King! Hide!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Okay, m'dear, this enclosure will be your new home!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@He's got a princess. Now we leap out and catch him red-handed.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Hai!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Snow blind!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Thin ice, thin ice, thin ice!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@...but once you get used to the smell of penguin manure, it's almost tolerable.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Ice King, hand over that princess!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Princess? What?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Jake, where's the princess?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Ooh, right.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@What princess?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@The, um... princess you were just talking to?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Yeah, the one you just came back from stealin'.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Wrong-o. I was at the hospital, for it turns out Gunter here was preggers!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Gunter@Wenk.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@I was just talking to the egg! It's such a cutie!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@Gunther's a woman?!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@What? No! Fuh. Anyway, get out of my house or I'll kill you, et cetera. I want to take a nap in my easy chair. What happened to my recliner?!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Ohh...@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@My skins and tubs!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@You even violated my secret sanctum?! What is wrong with you?!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@No princess?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@No! No princess!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@We messed up, Jake. We're... violators!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Yeah, what the heck?! You think you can just wreck my house and wear my collectibles?! Hah! Who do you guys think you are?!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@We're... ninjas?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@You're not ninjas! You're just a couple of jerks!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@It's true. Ice King, we're gonna make this right.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Yeah, do it; make it right. And start by, uh... oh, take my bag over to the cage.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Oh, no, no, no! Not that! Never mind! Put that down and go clean my gym equipment.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@Doctor Princess!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Oh, heh... I have no idea how that got in there!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn@What's goin' on?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Dr. Princess@I'll field that one. The Ice King abducted me while I was distracted by the horrifying beauty of birth.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Yes, Gunter's ailment was the perfect cover for stealing a princess, M.D.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Dr. Princess@I'm not even a real princess. "Princess" is just a surname. @The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Enough! You may have uncovered my princess-smuggling scheme, but you'll never leave this place alive!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@A couple of ninjas like me and Finn can only be defeated by another ninja!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Doot, doo, doooo! Ninja!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn and Jake@Ninja!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Dr. Princess@What am I... looking at here, exactly?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Finn, Jake and the Ice King@NINJA!@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Dr. Princess@So... how is your egg doing?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Gunter@Wenk, wenk.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Dr. Princess@Oh.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Gunter! Why didn't you tell me?@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Gunter@Weh-weh-wenk.@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Ice King@Oh, Gunter...@The Chamber of Frozen Blades
Jake@You want some more eggs, BMO?@Her Parents
BMO@Yes, please.@Her Parents
Jake@How 'bout you, Finny? Need a refill?@Her Parents
Finn@I'm pretty full, man... but lemme see if I can... rearrange. Nope. Can't do it.@Her Parents
Jake@I don't know if stomachs work like that, dude.@Her Parents
Finn@Sometimes it helps.@Her Parents
Jake@Can't argue with that! Ahh...@Her Parents
Finn@Ahh...@Her Parents
BMO@Ahh...@Her Parents
Jake@Hello? Lady, it's gonna be fine. Mm-hmm. Alright, I love you, too. Bye.@Her Parents
Finn@Lady Rainicorn again?@Her Parents
Jake@Yeah, man. She's worried about introducing me to her parents at lunch today. She thinks they're gonna freak out.@Her Parents
Finn@Um... maybe give her parents some treasure?@Her Parents
Jake@No way! That's our treasure! Wait. I've got it, dude! I'll invite them over early, smooth them over using my personality, and we'll all be best friends before Lady gets here so she doesn't have to feel nervous! It's perfect! I'll just send them a quick Prism-gram. Mm-hmm.@Her Parents
Finn@What's it say?@Her Parents
Jake@Hold on. It's still converting the light waves into brain waves. Ahh... They're into it, dude!@Her Parents
Finn@Sweet! Let's go powder our noses!@Her Parents
Finn@Why's Lady so nervous, anyway?@Her Parents
Jake@Well... she didn't really say, but it might have somethin' to do with the Rainicorn-Dog Wars.@Her Parents
Finn@There were wars between rainicorns and dogs?@Her Parents
Jake@Horrifying wars. For thousands of years, rainicorns battled dogs over territory in the Crystal Dimension... but Lady and I are cool.@Her Parents
Finn@Dude! Her parents are probably all full of dog-hatred from the war-times! They're gonna see you're a dog and forbid Lady from ever hanging out with you again!@Her Parents
Jake@...Nah. That could never happen.@Her Parents
Finn@You didn't think this through enough... IT COULD HAPPEN!!@Her Parents
Jake@AAAH! I'M A MORON!@Her Parents
Finn@Don't worry. I've got a plan that's gonna solve this biz. Homies help homies. Always.@Her Parents
Jake@I'm ready to hear your plan, homie.@Her Parents
Finn@Haha, yeah! This plan is perfect!@Her Parents
Jake@You know, I thought painting ourselves rainbow-color using condiments and stuff from the fridge so we could pretend to be rainicorns was a good idea when you pitched it to me five minutes ago, but now I'm not so sure, man.@Her Parents
Finn@Come ooonnn. Trust me, homie.@Her Parents
Jake@No, no, no, new plan. First, we're gonna clean this place up, and then— Huh?!@Her Parents
Ethel@Jake?@Her Parents
Jake@AAAAH... LET'S HIDE AND BURN THE HOUSE DOWN!@Her Parents
Bob@Hello?@Her Parents
Jake@안녕하세요. ("Hello.")@Her Parents
Ethel@Jake, is that you?@Her Parents
Jake@Uh-huh.@Her Parents
Ethel@Are you going to let us in?@Her Parents
Jake@Y-yeeeaaah...@Her Parents
Ethel@AAAAAAHHHH!!!@Her Parents
Jake@I can explain!! I can explain!!@Her Parents
Ethel@OOOHHHHH, he's so handsome! Oh, Bob, our daughter's finally found a handsome rainicorn to love!@Her Parents
Jake@You think I'm a rainicorn?@Her Parents
Bob@I think we can spot a member of our own species, Jake. We're not blind.@Her Parents
Ethel@Well, we are a little blind.@Her Parents
Bob@Yes, I guess we are a little blind.@Her Parents
Jake@Uh, well, hey! Come on in! It's awesome to finally meet you both!@Her Parents
Ethel@Your house is very colorful. I like that!@Her Parents
Finn@Haha! The plan is working, homie!@Her Parents
Bob@Jake, what is that thing that's talking?@Her Parents
Jake@Uh... that's um...@Her Parents
Finn@I'm Jake's rainicorn roommate! Everyone do the traditional rainicorn rain dance!@Her Parents
Bob@Jake, please ask your goblin butler to stop insulting my heritage!@Her Parents
Jake@Uh... y-yes! Get outta here, goblin! Go fetch us some rainicorn snacks!@Her Parents
Finn@But—@Her Parents
Jake@Come on, homie, help me!@Her Parents
Finn@Ha! You got it, homie!@Her Parents
Jake@Uh... please, c-come upstairs.@Her Parents
Jake@My goblin will bring us snacks in a moment.@Her Parents
Bob@Thank you, Jake. I'm glad the wife and I made the trip from the Crystal Dimension.@Her Parents
Ethel@Yes, we're eager to know more about the studly young rainicorn that's dating our daughter.@Her Parents
Bob@Ethel...@Her Parents
Jake@Well, ask me whatever you like, Ethel, Bob!@Her Parents
Ethel@I am a little curious about your goblin. He looks a little odd.@Her Parents
Jake@Well... he's actually a human.@Her Parents
Ethel@Oh, Bob! Our future-son-in-law must be filthy-rich to afford a human butler!@Her Parents
Bob@Shh. Thank you, Jake, for being interested in our daughter!@Her Parents
Jake@Uh... No problem, Bob!@Her Parents
Ethel@Oh! Let's play some traditional rainicorn games!@Her Parents
Bob@Jake, do you know Cameladabalawabapp?@Her Parents
Jake@Uh, s-say it again?@Her Parents
Bob@Cameladabalawabapp!@Her Parents
Jake@Ohhhh! Cablatapuamba—! I thought you said "Kabloderaga—"! Ah, man, I love gettin' down and dirty with some Cablatapuamba—! Ha! Y'all should go first, though.@Her Parents
Bob@Hmm. Bold move letting your opponent move first, Jake. I respect that. Very well. Cameladabalawabapp!!@Her Parents
Ethel@Oh, Bob!@Her Parents
Bob@Haha! Your turn, Jake!@Her Parents
Jake@I...@Her Parents
Finn@Snacks! Get your snacks!@Her Parents
Jake@Finn! Dude! I have to show Lady's parents that I have rainbow powers! I need homie help!@Her Parents
Finn@Hmm... I got a plan, bro-ham. Just stretch your horn at me, and I'll take care of the rest.@Her Parents
Jake@You're the best, homie.@Her Parents
Finn@Homies help homies.@Her Parents
Jake@Haha! Cablatapuamba—!@Her Parents
Ethel@Very unusual color palette, Jake.@Her Parents
Bob@Yes. Subtle.@Her Parents
Jake@Whoo! Oh, yeah! Finn?@Her Parents
Bob@How about we play some more traditional rainicorn games, my boy?@Her Parents
Jake@I, uh... Oh. Um... let's do it!@Her Parents
Bob and Ethel@Let the games begin!@Her Parents
Jake@I'm sorry.@Her Parents
Jake@Yo, my bad! I'll get 'im! Hey, man. How's it goin'?@Her Parents
Finn@IT'S "GOING" CRUD-COW!@Her Parents
Jake@I know, I know, I'm sorry. But they really like me. Your plan is working perfectly!@Her Parents
Finn@Being poked in the buns and laughed at was not in my plan! Not in the plan!@Her Parents
Jake@Look, Finn, you know I got yo back fo'-eva', but right now, you're the only one who can help me. Come on, homie. Homies help homies. Hey, guys. You ready to get this game goin' again?@Her Parents
Ethel@Oh, no, we're pooped.@Her Parents
Bob@Yeah, we're about ready to break out our picnic basket and dig in!@Her Parents
Jake@Wohhh, no. You're my guests. Let me take care of you. Homie... help me cook something, please.@Her Parents
Finn@...Okay.@Her Parents
Jake@Thanks, Finn. Okay. Don't worry about a thing. Finn'll make a great lunch. He's a little raw, but he's got great taste.@Her Parents
Bob@What?! Wow! So wealthy, and so generous!@Her Parents
Ethel@Ah! I was hoping! I was afraid to ask!@Her Parents
Finn@WAAAH! Jake!! I think they wanna eat me!!@Her Parents
Ethel@Of course we do! Jake said you'd "make a great lunch"!@Her Parents
Finn@JAKE! COME ON!@Her Parents
Jake@Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man....@Her Parents
Finn@AAAH! Knock it off, Bob!!@Her Parents
Ethel@Don't you touch him!!@Her Parents
Jake@Come on, stop it, guys! Come on, y'all, I said stop! NOW, THAT'S ENOUGH!!! Nobody's eating Finn!! He's not my butler, and he's not food! Finn is my friend! I'm sorry I let the lies get so far outta hand. I just got so scared of losing Lady! But if they hate me, so be it. No more lies.@Her Parents
Ethel@You're a dog?@Her Parents
Jake@Yeah, I just... Look, I'm sorry about everything. I was—@Her Parents
Bob@YAAAAAY! HA-HEEEY! HURRAAAAY!@Her Parents
Jake@Uh... uh... Lady?!@Her Parents
Lady Rainicorn@어, 나도 우리 부모님 때문에 걱정했었어! 우리 엄마아빠는 개라면 완전 맛이 가거든! 개가 전쟁터에서 우리 아빠 생명을 구해줬었어! ("Oh, I was worried about my parents! My mom and dad are crazy about dogs! A dog saved my dad in the war!")@Her Parents
Finn@What did she say?@Her Parents
Jake@She said she worried that they'd freak out... 'cause her parents are bananas for dogs!@Her Parents
Finn@J.J. FLIP! What the zip?!@Her Parents
Jake@Yeah! She says a dog saved her dad in the war!@Her Parents
Finn@Wow! That's flippin' awesome.@Her Parents
Ethel@Finn.@Her Parents
Finn@...Wha?@Her Parents
Ethel@Listen, I just want you to know how sorry we are about... trying to eat you.@Her Parents
Bob@It's just we thought we'd never get another chance. We thought humans were extinct.@Her Parents
Finn@Oh.@Her Parents
Jake@So... this isn't human?@Her Parents
Ethel@Oh, no. This is soy people!@Her Parents
Finn@Oh.@Her Parents
Ethel@I've never tasted real human before, but they say you can't even tell the difference!@Her Parents
Jake@Ew... Soy? FINN, YOU'RE DELICIOUS!@Her Parents
Finn@Jake. Jake! Hey man, shouldn't we conserve our energy? The Ice Cream Marathon starts tomorrow.@The Pods
Jake@I know what the Ice Cream Marathon is. I've been training for weeks. And I am determined to eat more ice cream at the Ice Cream Marathon than anyone else!@The Pods
Finn@You sure like ice cream.@The Pods
Jake@Ice cream is good!@The Pods
Jake@What the croak was that?@The Pods
Finn@It came from over there .@The Pods
Finn@Whoa, Jake! Check it out!@The Pods
Finn@It's a brave little Gnome Knight.@The Pods
Jake@What? That's a frog dressed up like a Gnome Knight.@The Pods
Frog@Actually, I'm a Gnome Knight who was magically transformed into a frog. And then I decided to continue being a knight.@The Pods
Jake@And now you're, like, attracting a mate?@The Pods
Frog@No! I'm on the verge of death!@The Pods
Jake@Oh. Well, you should just let go, man.@The Pods
Finn@Yeah, you've had a good run.@The Pods
Frog@No! I cannot die until I find a being whose spirit is brave and pure to take over my quest.@The Pods
Finn@Quest?@The Pods
Jake@Uh-oh. Somebody's gonna do a quest for a frog.@The Pods
Finn@Tell me more about this... quest.@The Pods
Frog@I have to guard these magic beans.@The Pods
Jake@Huh?@The Pods
Frog@Two of the beans are good, but one is horribly evil! I have no idea which is which. So I've spent my life guarding them, preventing them from ever being planted.@The Pods
Jake@Beans?! Ah ha ha! Magic beans... hee! We'll be right back. Come on, Finn. I think I dropped my spoon in the bush.@The Pods
Finn@We will take your quest.@The Pods
Frog@You will?@The Pods
Finn@Sure! Consider it guarded.@The Pods
Frog@Also, take this .@The Pods
Finn@Oh. Okay. Thanks.@The Pods
Frog@No, thank you.@The Pods
Finn@Whoa!@The Pods
Jake@Dude, what's goin' on?@The Pods
Finn@We took over the quest!@The Pods
Jake@What?! The beans? Now wait a second!@The Pods
Gnome Knight@Nope, too late.@The Pods
Finn@Ah, I miss him already.@The Pods
Jake@Well, we should get a move on if we wanna make the Ice Cream Marathon.@The Pods
Finn@What about the quest?@The Pods
Jake@Really? We have to do the bean quest?@The Pods
Finn@I gave him my word.@The Pods
Jake@Yeah, I wasn't here for that, so... can't we guard the beans and eat ice cream?@The Pods
Finn@No, man! We're on the job. And like you always say, "Work and fun don't mix..."@The Pods
Jake@"...unless you're a clown." I do say that a lot.@The Pods
Jake@Gee, sittin' in this hot sun, guarding beans. It sure beats 26 miles of vanilla ice cream. Or caramel ice cream. Or peach ice cream. Hey, what if we plant the beans ourselves?@The Pods
Finn@That's a terrible idea.@The Pods
Jake@No, wait, hear me out. See, if one of these beans is evil, then it's our duty to crush it, once and for all! Plus, two of the beans are good. If we plant them, we'll be bringin' twice as much good into the world!@The Pods
Finn@And we can make it to the Ice Cream Marathon!@The Pods
Jake@I hadn't even thought about that!@The Pods
Jake@I'm gonna take a cat nap.@The Pods
Finn@What? But we have to be ready for evil!@The Pods
Jake@If we take shifts, there's less chance of us falling asleep at the same time.@The Pods
Finn@Alright Finn, Jake's a lazy bum and this soil is ripe with evil. I cannot go to sleep until that evil bean sprouts and is destroyed.@The Pods
Finn@AAAH! Wake up, Jake! This is it!@The Pods
Jake@Huh? Oh!@The Pods
Finn@Aah! Bean pod! I can't tell if it's evil yet.@The Pods
Finn@Huh? Baby Pigs dressed in silly costumes?@The Pods
Jake@Aw, look how cute they look all sleepy and snore-y.@The Pods
Finn@Careful, Jake. It could be a trap. We should test them to see if they're... evil.@The Pods
Finn@Okay. Each one of you take one test and one pencil. You have one hour to complete the test and prove we shouldn't kill you. And begin.@The Pods
Jake@Aw, they're so cute they can hardly hold their pencils.@The Pods
Finn@That doesn't fare well for their... grade point average.@The Pods
Jake@Nothing evil could be this adorable.@The Pods
Finn@Hmm, you might be right. The only thing on here is a cute drawing of an ice cream cone under "Do you have allergies?" Yeah, nothing evil. Okay, the pigs are good.@The Pods
Jake@YES! You hear that, guys? You passed! A-plus! A-plus-plus!@The Pods
Finn@Oh, no! Jake, get ready. The second pod is about to drop. PROTECT THE PIGLETS!@The Pods
Jake@Stay back, babies!@The Pods
Finn@Show me what you have to offer, pod!@The Pods
Finn@Magical wands?@The Pods
Jake@What? COOL!@The Pods
Finn@Stop, Jake!@The Pods
Jake@WOW!@The Pods
Finn@Is it evil?@The Pods
Jake@It's a wand that poops glitter! What's good-er than that?! Whee-hee-hee-hee-hee!@The Pods
Finn@Hmm... Hahahaha! Glitter on its own could be evil. But with rainbows? Over my dead body!@The Pods
Jake@Hey, let's have some fun with these pigs before the evil pod shows up!@The Pods
Finn@Yeah!@The Pods
Finn@Phew!@The Pods
Jake@I'm exhausted!@The Pods
Finn@They look so sleepy and peaceful. We have to stay alert. The evil pod could appear at any time. When it does, we must be ready to destroy it immediately.@The Pods
Jake@And then go to the Ice Cream Marathon, right?@The Pods
Finn@Yeah, man.@The Pods
Jake@Okay. I'll take the first shift.@The Pods
Finn@Rhombus.@The Pods
Finn@AH! Look! The third pod!@The Pods
Jake@It's bigger than the other two, dude!@The Pods
Finn@Yeah, man. We've gotta kill it now.@The Pods
Jake@Huh? It's squirting!@The Pods
Finn@Squirting?!@The Pods
Jake@See? Squirting. Right here. Tastes good.@The Pods
Finn@Dang, man! Don't just lick stuff! It's evil!@The Pods
Jake@No, it's not. It's... ice cream!@The Pods
Finn@Is the evil sucking you in? JAKE!@The Pods

Finn@It's sheet music!@Mystery Train
Finn@It doesn't make any sense to me.@Mystery Train
Jake@Me neither! Maybe the murderer is just too smart for us.@Mystery Train
Finn@Yes! Jake, that's it! It's all so clear now! Gather everyone in the caboose and I will reveal a murderer!@Mystery Train
Finn@You're the only remaining passengers. So the murderer, is in this caboose.@Mystery Train
Finn@Let me explain how I know who the murderer is. I saw Pineapple Guy skim through the sheet music. Sheet music to a song that's very special to Lollipop Girl. A song that reminds her of Ice Cream Guy. Before Colonel Candy Corn's aide, Doctor Ice Cream was in possession of a basket of cabbage, fish and eggs. And you, Pineapple Guy, have cabbage bits on your socks! And you! Chocolate Bar Guy! Does this dictionary look familiar? A dictionary that contains the words Rid! Guests! At once!@Mystery Train
Finn@But the real murderer is someone no one suspects! The real murderer is-@Mystery Train
Finn@No one was the murderer?!@Mystery Train
Jake@The conductor's still on the train!@Mystery Train
Finn@Oh yeah! He did it.@Mystery Train
Jake@Yay, you did it, you solved it, Finn!@Mystery Train
Finn@I knew it; because he's creepy.@Mystery Train
Jake@What?! Humpf.@Mystery Train
Finn@I know. You knew he was the murderer all along. I couldn't have done it without you, you, you@Mystery Train
Jake@Thank you.@Mystery Train
Finn@You feel kinda bony. Jake? NOOOOOOOOOOO!@Mystery Train
Conductor@Hey.@Mystery Train
Finn@How could you murder all those Candy People?! And, you murdered Jake on my birthday!@Mystery Train
Conductor@Yes, and you're next.@Mystery Train
Finn@Wrong!@Mystery Train
Finn@I'm coming for you! This is for Jake! You're going down, or both of us are going down! My birthday wish, is vengeance! Happy birthday to me!!@Mystery Train
Conductor@Wait! [Stretches himself around to reveal that it is actually Jake covered in paint.@Mystery Train
Finn@You're alive!! You were the conductor the whole time?!@Mystery Train
Jake@Yup. You were so focused on the murders because you never even noticed! The skeletons were the hardest part. It was all an elaborate set up for your birthday present!@Mystery Train
Finn@So nobody was murdered?@Mystery Train
Jake@Nope! Not unless you count the train's control panel!@Mystery Train
Jake@Dude, open your eyes!@Mystery Train
Finn@Hey, we're alive!@Mystery Train
Candy People@-to you!@Mystery Train
Finn@Wow, this is the best birthday ever. Thanks, Jake.@Mystery Train
Jake@You deserve it, buddy. Because you're a great friend.@Mystery Train
Finn@I think my favorite part was landing on the Gelatin. That musta taken forever to plan.@Mystery Train
Jake@Nope! That part was a total accident.@Mystery Train
Finn@Oh. So we could have...@Mystery Train
Jake@Died horribly? Yes. Happy birthday, pal!@Mystery Train
Jake@Hey, man, it's Couples Only Movie Night tonight. Who are you bringin'?@Go With Me
Finn@I don't know. Who are you bringin'?@Go With Me
Jake@I'm bringing my girlfriend, dude.@Go With Me
Finn@Oh.@Go With Me
Finn@I'll take this duck!@Go With Me
Jake@It's couples night! You gotta bring someone you can smooch.@Go With Me
Finn@Man, I don't want to be smooched!@Go With Me
Jake@Don't have to smooch. You just have to bring someone you can smooch. It's, like, the rules.@Go With Me
Finn@Lame. Ah! Well, I'll take this blanket!@Go With Me
Jake@Put the blanket down. Have a seat. I want to explain some "things" to you about couples.@Go With Me
Jake@You all square?@Go With Me
Finn@Yeah, yeah.@Go With Me
Jake@Who you gonna call?@Go With Me
Finn@I'm going to call a girl I don't have to kiss.@Go With Me
Princess Bubblegum@Hello?@Go With Me
Finn@Hi Princess! Would you go to Couples Movie Night with me?@Go With Me
Princess Bubblegum@Sounds romantic, Finn.@Go With Me
Finn@No! I was just wondering if you wanted to go with me.@Go With Me
Princess Bubblegum@No, sorry, Finn. I'm busy practicing for the Whistling Choir Death Match Championship.@Go With Me
Finn@But—@Go With Me
Princess Bubblegum@Auf Wiedersehen! ("Goodbye")@Go With Me
Finn@She doesn't want to go!@Go With Me
Jake@Yes she does! We just need to help her realize that she wants to go to the movies with you. I'm calling Marceline.@Go With Me
Finn@What?@Go With Me
Jake@Look, man, I've been learning a lot about vampires lately. I realized my fear was based on ignorance!@Go With Me
Marceline@Speak.@Go With Me
Jake@Hey, hey, Marceline. Got a favor to ask, Babe. We've gotta make Princess Bubblegum jealous, so she'll go to the movies with Finn. Marceline? Come in. Hello?@Go With Me
Finn@Hehe. Are you gonna help us?@Go With Me
Marceline@Yeah, I'll help. It'll be funny.@Go With Me
Jake@Okay, so here's the plan. You start saying things and you start laughing waaay loud. And then Bubblegum... will get jealous of you . Which will awaken her Finn love! You start us off.@Go With Me
Finn@Um... hmm funny... funny... giddy up?@Go With Me
Finn@Hehe. Um... diggy diggy?@Go With Me
Finn@Diggy diggy! Diggy diggy!@Go With Me

Finn@I, um... uh... it's... something.@Go With Me
Princess Bubblegum@Well, then, keep it down out there! I'm trying to whistle practice!@Go With Me
Jake@That was great! Now, we begin Phase 2! It's so powerful! Wait here! Hehehe...@Go With Me
Marceline@Hey, look, Finn, I know Jake's your friend and all, but... if you really want Bubblegum to go to the movies with you, you've gotta like, stop taking advice from your dog and take some advice from a real girl!@Go With Me
Finn@But Jake said Phase 2 is powerful!@Go With Me
Marceline@How is Jake going to know what girls want more than a real girl?@Go With Me
Finn@Yeah...@Go With Me
Marceline@Okay great. So what we need now is something... fun! Girls love fun more than anything. Fun, fun, fun! If you can show Princess Bubblegum you're fun, she'll deffs wanna go to the movies with you.@Go With Me
Finn@Haha, you said fun so much, it sounds all weird now. Fun. F—@Go With Me
Marceline@So... what do you like to do for fun, Finn?@Go With Me
Finn@Oh, Oh! I like to wrestle! And fight! But girls don't like that.@Go With Me
Marceline@No, no, that's perfect! All you need to do is get in there and wrestle Princess Bubblegum to show her how fun you are.@Go With Me
Finn@Ffffffuuunnn. Ffffuuunn.@Go With Me
Jake@Whoa, where you going, man? Check it out!@Go With Me
Finn@What is that stuff?@Go With Me
Jake@It's a lute-suit! Girls love it! Trust me.@Go With Me
Marceline@Finn! What the plum are you wearing? You look horrible!@Go With Me
Jake@It's a lute-suit! And Finn looks adorable in it!@Go With Me
Marceline@Well, it's going to ruin the plan.@Go With Me
Jake@What she talking about, Finn?@Go With Me
Finn@Well... I was going to give Marceline's plan a try, too.@Go With Me
Jake@Her idea?! What's wrong with my idea?@Go With Me
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, hey, Finn! Did'ya ever find some—Whoa! What are you wearing?@Go With Me
Finn@Oh... this is my... Lute... suit.@Go With Me

Princess Bubblegum@Finn, that is hilarious! Oh, you are killing me!@Go With Me
Marcelince@Psst!@Go With Me

Princess Bubblegum@Guards!@Go With Me
Marceline@That suit was ridiculous.@Go With Me
Jake@Ridi—Ridiculous? What? Can you believe this girl, Finn? Huh? Can ya?@Go With Me
Finn@Uh... I guess the suit did feel... a little silly.@Go With Me
Jake@Well, fine! You can just give it back then!@Go With Me
Finn@I'm sorry!@Go With Me
Jake@Good luck getting to that movie without my help! Ruff.@Go With Me
Marceline@Gee, he seems pretty ticked.@Go With Me
Finn@Naw, he just needs some spaghetti.@Go With Me
Marceline@Oh, okay. Well taste this, then. I've gotta a new plan.@Go With Me
Finn@Really?@Go With Me
Marceline@The only thing women like more than fun is excitement! She needs to feel her blood pump, man! She needs to... be chased by wolves!@Go With Me
Finn@Like metaphorically?@Go With Me
Marceline@Come on, I'll teach ya how to show a girl a good time. Wraps Finn's arms around her.] Hold tight. You ready?@Go With Me
Finn@Uhh... Mhmm.@Go With Me
Marceline@Shhh! She's probably asleep!@Go With Me
Finn@This was a really good idea.@Go With Me
Marceline@Now don't blow it this time!@Go With Me
Finn@Haha, okay.@Go With Me
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, Finn, thank goodness you're here! There's wolves in my room!@Go With Me
Finn@Yeah, I know! I put them there! Pretty exciting, right? Heh heh.@Go With Me
Princess Bubblegum@I'm sorry to do this, Finn. But until you stop acting like a psycho, you're forbidden from entering the Candy Kingdom. Farewell.@Go With Me
Finn@I don't understand, Marceline. I tried everything. I guess she just doesn't like me.@Go With Me
Marceline@Shhh. Come on, Finn, a brainlord like Bonnie? You'll be bored with her in a week! And anyway I, for one, think you're pretty great. Sorry it didn't work out the way you wanted. See you later, I guess!@Go With Me
Finn@Marceline! Of course! It's been Marceline all along!@Go With Me
Jake@Hey, man, I've been looking for you. Sorry for acting like a dweeb before. Want some leftover spaghetti?@Go With Me
Finn@Ah, no, thanks, man. But I really need your help!@Go With Me

Marceline@We need to talk...@Go With Me
Finn@Good evening my dear, your escort is here!@Go With Me
Marceline@Finn, you do NOT want to go down that road with me.@Go With Me
Finn@With you, I would walk down any road, m'lady. Especially, if it leads to the movies.@Go With Me
Marceline@Oh, yeah? No one would want to go to the movies with... this! What do you think of me now?@Go With Me
Finn@How do you like your popcorn?@Go With Me
Marceline@Uuugh! You're starting to annoy me!@Go With Me
Finn@Well then let's do something fun, like go to the movies!@Go With Me
Marceline@Get off me! Finn, I like you, but I—@Go With Me
Finn@Headlock!@Go With Me
Marceline@No! Listen to me. I'm not going to go to the movies with you! I just don't like you... that way.@Go With Me
Marceline@I'm sorry Finn, I just... I don't wanna date you.@Go With Me
Finn@Date me? I just wanna go to the movies. But everybody hates me.@Go With Me
Marceline@Wait, you don't want me to be your girlfriend?@Go With Me
Finn@Huh? No! Movies!@Go With Me
Marceline@If you weren't looking for a girlfriend then why were you romancing it up all day?@Go With Me
Finn@'Cause Jake said Couples Night had weird kissing requirements and romance initiation rituals and whatever else.@Go With Me
Jake@I didn't really say all that.@Go With Me
Marceline@Of course I'll go with you, Finn!@Go With Me
Finn@You will?@Go With Me
Marceline@Yeah, as friends.@Go With Me
Finn@Of course as friends!@Go With Me

Cubby@I heard what you said... about this being a monster's belly? I've been telling everyone that for three days!@Belly of the Beast

Older bear@Hmm...@Belly of the Beast
Finn@Cubby, is there anything we can do to help?@Belly of the Beast
Cubby@You could talk to Party Pat.@Belly of the Beast
Finn@Party Pat?@Belly of the Beast
Cubby@He's our chief. If you can convince him to leave, all will follow.@Belly of the Beast
Finn@Can you take us to him?@Belly of the Beast
Cubby@Sure. He sleeps on the monster's heart. It's like a blood waterbed.@Belly of the Beast

Party Pat@But you haven't been partying.@Belly of the Beast
Finn@What?!@Belly of the Beast
Party Pat@You move to music, but that's not dancing. You chew pancakes, but you're not tasting. To truly party, one must leave behind the problems that are troubling and open one's mind eye. I'm just kiddin'. You guys are party animals. This is just a sticker! You can stay in our cave as long as you want.@Belly of the Beast
Finn@That's what I've been trying to tell you, man! This isn't a cave—y'all are partyin' in a monster's BELLY!@Belly of the Beast
Party Pat@Oh, yeah. That makes sense. It's definitely the weirdest cave I've ever seen. Heh heh.@Belly of the Beast

Finn@All those bears... are gonna turn into the stuff.@Belly of the Beast
Jake@Shh. Seriously? The only foreseeable threat might be all these trees being swallowed, but they're not hurtin' nothin'.@Belly of the Beast
Finn@Yeah, good thing he isn't swallowing some deadly volcano lava. That would kill them for sure.@Belly of the Beast
Finn & Jake@Whoaa.@Belly of the Beast
Finn@The monster is headed toward that volcano!@Belly of the Beast
Monster@Uh-huh.@Belly of the Beast
Finn@We gotta warn the bears!@Belly of the Beast
Finn@If we bum everyone out, maybe they'll listen to us.@Belly of the Beast
Jake@Oh, okay.@Belly of the Beast
Finn@Just follow my lead.@Belly of the Beast
Finn@You bears gotta get outta here or you're all gonna be melted by lava!@Belly of the Beast
Finn@Party Pat, do you know of another exit?@Belly of the Beast
Party Pat@Well, there's the dark and mysterious mine, but nobody uses it anymore.@Belly of the Beast
Finn@He must be talkin' about the butt intestines! C'mon, Jake, we gotta get outta here!@Belly of the Beast
Jake@Ehhhhh.@Belly of the Beast
Finn@One more bandage.@Belly of the Beast
Finn@Huzzah! The party bears are safe, Party Pat. Y'all can party out here now.@Belly of the Beast
Party Pat@No. To survive, my people need a phat party club to grind in. That monster's gut was totally excellent.@Belly of the Beast
Jake@You're sick, Party Pat. I'm gonna go watch TV.@Belly of the Beast
Finn@Hmmm.@Belly of the Beast
Monster@Ohh...@Belly of the Beast
Finn@Pat, he's not gonna let you back in his mouth. You scorched it all up with fireworks! Unless... Party Pat! Party... pancakes.@Belly of the Beast

Finn & Jake@That's even better!@Video Makers
Finn@Uhh, what do you think?@Video Makers
Jake@I don't get it. It's just a bunch of random junk.@Video Makers
Finn@Yeah, I'm not engaged. I need to see something that reflects life as it is, but, you know, entertaining.@Video Makers
Jake@Yeah, like a romantic comedy.@Video Makers
Finn@Exactly. An action adventure.@Video Makers
Jake@Wait, that's not what I said.@Video Makers
Finn@Let's get to filming!@Video Makers
Finn@Okay, Slime Princess! In this scene, you're gonna leap over to that vine, swim over the crocodiles, do a triple flip with a full twist and land clean. Don't fall in the water, or you'll get eaten alive. Action!@Video Makers
Finn@No! No smooching! Cut.@Video Makers
Jake@I thought it was great.@Video Makers
Finn@No, we can't use any of it.@Video Makers
Jake@I think we should use all of it.@Video Makers
Finn@No, not all. We should throw away the parts where Slime Princess was smoochin'. That was dumb.@Video Makers
Jake@What?@Video Makers
Finn@Duuuumb-ah. @Video Makers
Jake@Okay, you're having a picnic, you're in love but you can't admit it. So you're having a playful food fight. And action.@Video Makers
LSP@Why did you do that?@Video Makers
Jake@Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut, that was not what I wanted!@Video Makers
Finn@That was awesome! We need to shoot more stuff like that.@Video Makers
Jake@What's next?@Video Makers
Finn@Okay PB, move back a little. Stop.@Video Makers
Princess Bubblegum@Finn.@Video Makers
Finn@Yeah.@Video Makers
Princess Bubblegum@How does this work?@Video Makers
Finn@Umm, Jake's gonna get the frog to hop toward him and when he does, you're gonna run along side the chariot and it's gonna look like you're driving it.@Video Makers
Princess Bubblegum@Okay.@Video Makers
Jake@Hey, Finn.@Video Makers
Finn@Yeah.@Video Makers
Jake@How 'bout when the chariot takes off, she says something like, "Mmm, check, please."@Video Makers
Finn@What? No, that's terrible. And action!@Video Makers
Princess Bubblegum@Check, please...?@Video Makers
Finn@Hah, Jake. You... you brought the fly in too close!@Video Makers
Jake@I'm sorry.@Video Makers
Finn@Well, help me catch 'im.@Video Makers
Jake@Well, I thought it was funny.@Video Makers
Finn@This isn't a comedy!@Video Makers
Jake@Not the way you're shootin' it.@Video Makers
Finn@Look, just help me catch this guy.@Video Makers
Jake@All right, but after this we do my part.@Video Makers
Jake@Okay, everyone. It's been a long day. A lot of... A lot of running around, chasing frogs . But we are makin' a movie, and this is the big wedding scene. Mr. Cupcake, you're playing Todd Johnson.@Video Makers
Mr. Cupcake@Yes.@Video Makers
Jake@And Lady, you confess that you never loved Todd Johnson and that you were just trying to win a bet with your snooty socialite friends.@Video Makers
Lady Rainicorn@알았어, 제이크. ("Okay, Jake.")@Video Makers
Jake@And then, you both realize you do love each other and you both say "I do." And then Shelby, you say...@Video Makers
Shelby@Check, please.@Video Makers
Jake@Heh, heh, heh. Yeah. Don't forget to look right at the camera and slap your cheeks like this. And 1, 2, 3 action!@Video Makers
Shelby@Do you, Todd Johnson, take this Rainicorn to be your lawfully married wife?@Video Makers
Jake@Lady! Cut! Cut, cut, cut! I didn't tell you to flex out!@Video Makers
Lady Rainicorn@자기야, 흥분하지 마. ("Don't take it seriously, honey.")@Video Makers
Jake@No, I don't like the way he's flexing at you.@Video Makers
Mr. Cupcake@I don't hear her complaining.@Video Makers
Jake@Why you... GAAH!@Video Makers
Shelby@Check, please.@Video Makers
Finn@How much longer till you finish editing, BMO?@Video Makers

Finn@Jake, let's talk about our movie.@Video Makers

Jake@Uh-huh.@Video Makers
Finn@But I'm thinkin' only half of it is usable.@Video Makers
Jake@Me, too.@Video Makers
Finn@Really?@Video Makers
Jake@Yeah, I was just thinking that.@Video Makers
Finn@That's great!@Video Makers
Jake@I know.@Video Makers

BMO@Eeee...@Video Makers
Finn@Well, I guess we'll see!@Video Makers
Jake@Yeah, I guess we will. Start the movie, BMO.@Video Makers
LSP@It's a little awkward.@Video Makers
LSP@Oh, my gosh!@Video Makers

Jake@Me too, dude.@Video Makers
LSP@Oh, my gosh, you guys. I can't wait till next week's movie club.@Video Makers
BMO@Check, please.@Video Makers
Jake@That's a good one, BMO!@Video Makers
Jake@Ommmmm...@Mortal Folly
Finn@Jake! What am I supposed to be meditatin' about?@Mortal Folly
Jake@Don't know. I'm thinking of pillows stuffed with spaghetti.@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@Clear your minds.@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@I have to go check on something!@Mortal Folly
Finn@Can we go with?@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@...Perhaps you are ready to go with. Guys, you'll need to put these on. Pull back your hat.@Mortal Folly
Jake@Neat!@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@Stay close to me. @Mortal Folly
Finn@Whoa!@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@At the heart of this tree is an ancient evil, held in a prison of amber—the Lich.@Mortal Folly
Finn@What's that sound?@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@He's casting spells—trying to get in your head and control your bod... but these gems are protecting our minds from his influence. If we lost the gems, we'd be defenseless. He would have full control over us.@Mortal Folly
Finn@That's freakin' nuts!@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@Beyond Iceberg Lake lies the ruins of the Lich's tower, where he was converting the planet's life force into unholy power to destroy all of Ooo... but before he could, the Legendary Billy attacked him and pummeled him into the resin of this tree. I—WHAT THE NUTS?!@Mortal Folly
Finn@Dude, be a big sword!@Mortal Folly
Jake@Oh, okay! I'll try!@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@Quickly! To the other secret room! There's only one known weapon that can harm the Lich. The Gauntlet of the Hero.@Mortal Folly
Voice@BIIILLYYYYYYY!!!@Mortal Folly
Jake@Billy's big ol' beef fingers!@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@Finn, you have but one chance. While the Lich isn't at full power, you must smite him with this gauntlet! His only desire... is to destroy life. If you fail... he'll kill everyone.@Mortal Folly
Finn@No. That will not happen.@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, and there's something else that I want you to have. The Lich's lair is supposed to be cold. ...I just don't want you to get sick. Take this sweater. I made it myself. I'm not great at knitting, but please wear it. I care about you, Finn.@Mortal Folly
Finn@I love it.@Mortal Folly
Jake@Me, too!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@Hey hey hey! So... I've been thinking about this a lot lately and, well, uh... phew, gosh, I'm so nervous... Finn, and Jake, will you give me your blessings so I can marry Princess Bubblegum?@Mortal Folly
Jake@What is wrong with you?!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@What's wrong with me?! No! Not the latch!@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@Quickly now, Finn! Track the Lich by his trail of death.@Mortal Folly
Finn@Here I go!@Mortal Folly
Jake@Here I go!@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@Be safe!@Mortal Folly
Jake@This is our first fate-of-the-world deal!@Mortal Folly
Finn@Yeah, man! We gotta shut this fool down hardcore!@Mortal Folly
Jake@Running this fast makes my stomach hurt!@Mortal Folly
Finn@Run through it, man! We gotta get beyond Iceberg Lake before the Lich!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@Oh, my! How clumsy of me!@Mortal Folly
Finn@What the heck, Ice King?!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@Hey, wait, you guys! I'm serious about Bubblegum! Look, I wrote her name all over my arms and legs!@Mortal Folly
Finn and Jake@Yugh!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@Guys! It's not fair! She always hangs out with you, and it's not like you wanna marry her!@Mortal Folly
Finn@Why are you following us?!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@Whoa! I told you already. I want your blessings so I can marry Princess Bubblegum! Come on, guys, give me permission to marry her! I'll... I'll do a little dance for you! Hmm? You like this?@Mortal Folly
Finn@No!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@Oh, come on! If you bless our wedding, then maybe she'll really love me.@Mortal Folly
Finn@Ice King, go away, man.@Mortal Folly
Ice King@I will! When you bless our wedding!@Mortal Folly
Finn@No thanks, guy. Hmm? How does this gauntlet work?!@Mortal Folly
Jake@Whoa!@Mortal Folly
Finn@I can't turn it off!@Mortal Folly
Jake@Punch it in the eye!@Mortal Folly
Finn@Phew!@Mortal Folly
Jake@Let's blow this stand!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@I tried to do this right, but you've driven me to this—driven me to bad doing.@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, Finn and Jake, please be okay. Please be okay... please be okay...@Mortal Folly
Ice King@Eh... stupid thing... come on... eh...@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@Ice King?! Get outta here!!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@I didn't want to do this, but by not blessing our wedding, Finn and Jake have forced me to kidnap you.@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@That's insane!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@I know! But I'll show them... I'll show them how they've hurt us!@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@NO!!@Mortal Folly
Jake@There! Out over the lake!@Mortal Folly
Finn@After his butt!@Mortal Folly
Jake@I'm your dingy dog!@Mortal Folly
Finn@Here! I'll help paddle! Hey. It's me. Aw, come on. I'm sorry I punched you in the ball.@Mortal Folly
Jake@Waaaah!@Mortal Folly
Finn@Ah, yeah, haha! Closing in... Gonna get you, man! Closer, Jake! Closer... closer...@Mortal Folly
Ice King@Ah!@Mortal Folly
Finn@PRINCESS?! NO!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@Oh, no. Oh, gross. This water stinks.@Mortal Folly
Finn@ICE KING!!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@Look! Look what you've made me do to her!@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@Guys! Don't let the Lich reach his well of power! Oh, no!! He's made it!!@Mortal Folly
Finn@Don't worry, Princess!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@Hey, where're you guys goin'? What's goin' on?@Mortal Folly
Finn@I don't have time for this!@Mortal Folly
Jake@Then let's go!@Mortal Folly
Finn@My pack!!@Mortal Folly
Jake@It's okay!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@Man... I-I wanna go after them, but... that hole looks scary, doesn't it? Well! Holes are holes!@Mortal Folly
Finn@The Lich!@Mortal Folly
Jake@He's gettin' his powers back! Weird!@Mortal Folly
Finn@No! Prepare thyself... to get smote in the name of Bubblegum!!@Mortal Folly
The Lich@Shhhh...@Mortal Folly
Ice King@Yep! Holes are holes! NYEH!!@Mortal Folly
Jake@Look out!! That's it! I'm gonna bark 'im!@Mortal Folly
The Lich@Finn...@Mortal Folly
Finn@Oh, no.@Mortal Folly
The Lich@Finn... Come...@Mortal Folly
Finn@STOP!!!@Mortal Folly
The Lich@Aren't you cold... Finn...? Walk into the well... Finn... Aren't you cold...?@Mortal Folly
Finn@NO, I'M NOT!! I'VE GOT A SWEATER ON!!@Mortal Folly
The Lich@You are a joke to me!!@Mortal Folly
Finn@This sweater... It's keeping me safe!@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum's voice@I care about you, Finn...@Mortal Folly
Finn@This is it. The ultimate weapon against evil—the power of... l-l-l-l...llliking someone a lot. LICH!!!@Mortal Folly
Jake@Finn!! Buddy!!@Mortal Folly
Finn@Jake? Jake!@Mortal Folly
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, Finn... you did it!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@We did? Hey, yeah, we did it!! Oh, you guys! This experience has brought us all so much closer together! Princess, I'm sorry for all of this. I love you, and I've decided to set you free. Go free!!@Mortal Folly
Ice King@Uh... Whoops, I've got the dropsies!@Mortal Folly
Nurse Pound Cake@What's her condition, Dr. Ice Cream?@Mortal Recoil
Dr. Ice Cream@She's totally gross over 90% of her body. The other 10% is crazy nasty.@Mortal Recoil
Nurse Pound Cake@Will she make it, Doctor?@Mortal Recoil
Dr. Ice Cream@I don't know, Nurse Pound Cake. Put sugar on 'er! Two scoops! We're losing 'er!!@Mortal Recoil
Ice King@No! Not my number one! Princess, if you die on me, I will never forgive you! I'll be lost—lost in my own emotional labyri—@Mortal Recoil
Finn@YAAAAAH!!@Mortal Recoil
Dr. Ice Cream@Wait, Finn!@Mortal Recoil
Finn@What!?@Mortal Recoil
Dr. Ice Cream@Her sugar levels are stabilizing.@Mortal Recoil
Princess Bubblegum@Yes, I'm fine. I just need to rest.@Mortal Recoil
Ice King@Oh, my wife! Is there anything weird about her? I can't see through these pain tears!@Mortal Recoil
Dr. Ice Cream@She's fine. Why?@Mortal Recoil
Ice King@It's just that... after Princess fell into the well, I saw something strange happen. Something I still don't understand. Ooh—AGH! Wait! Listen to me!!@Mortal Recoil
Finn@NO! Just shut your face, old man!@Mortal Recoil
Ice King@"Old man?" Heh! What? I'm not old.@Mortal Recoil
Jake@Uh, yeah, you are, dude.@Mortal Recoil
Ice King@Old? I'm... I see. It's all making sense now. Brrrrapapo! I'm going, Princess. I'm sorry if my skin grossed you out. Nobody wants to see this old skin, I guess. Nobody in the world.@Mortal Recoil
Finn@JUST GET OUT OF HERE!!@Mortal Recoil
Ice King@Peace.@Mortal Recoil
Finn@Sorry about that, Peebles.@Mortal Recoil
Princess Bubblegum@The ice wizard is a weak fool....@Mortal Recoil

Jake@Yeah, man, and then we'll do magic tricks.@Mortal Recoil
Finn@Like fake magic?@Mortal Recoil

Jake@Oh, jeez!! What's wrong with Princess Bubblegum?!@Mortal Recoil
Finn@Quiet, dude. We're supposed to take care of her, not make her feel bad!@Mortal Recoil
Jake@I know, man, but she just seems... weird.@Mortal Recoil
Finn@She's just messed up from the accident, man. We just have to take care of her 'til she feels better.@Mortal Recoil
Jake@Uh... Okay, dude.@Mortal Recoil
Finn@Princess! Princess, no! You shouldn't be out of bed! Princess... I... I gotta tell ya somethin'. Uh... Jake...@Mortal Recoil
Jake@Oh. Gotcha. I'll go get some tea!@Mortal Recoil

Ice King@Hey, Finn, are you dead or what?@Mortal Recoil
Finn@Whaaah?... Ice King? What are you doing here?@Mortal Recoil
Ice King@Hey. I had to keep an eye on the princess because she's being possessed by the Lich.@Mortal Recoil
Finn@You don't know that.@Mortal Recoil
Ice King@But I do. I saw it with my wizard eyes! In the well, I saw something come out of the Lich and go into the princess. But I wasn't sure it was real because when you have stanky old wizard eyes, sometimes you see things that are real, and other times it's like crazy crazy crazy in your face all the time! All the time... Guys, let me help you. I don't want my future wife to be... physically unattractive.@Mortal Recoil
Finn@Listen, you old poot. I'm not going to let you kill 'er twice. GET STUFFED. Come on, Jake.@Mortal Recoil

Finn@IS PB OKAY?!?@Mortal Recoil
Nurse Pound Cake@Yes... but there were some complications.@Mortal Recoil
Finn@NOOOOOOO!!!!@Mortal Recoil
Nurse Pound Cake@Yes... I'm afraid... there wasn't enough gum to work with, so it appears Princess Bubblegum is now...... younger. She's 13 years old now.@Mortal Recoil
Ice King@Aw, dang it! Well, I'm outta here. Goodbye, everyone.@Mortal Recoil
Finn@13 years old? That's how old I am. Uh...@Mortal Recoil
Jake@Whoa...@Mortal Recoil
Princess Bubblegum@Give me a hug, hero.@Mortal Recoil

Finn@Marceline! We brought Heat Signature.@Heat Signature
Marceline@Woot! Woot!@Heat Signature
Jake@Woo!@Heat Signature
Marceline@Hey, so I want you all to meet Finn and Jake. They aren't... completely lame.@Heat Signature
Finn@Whatup?@Heat Signature
Marceline@Guys, this is Wendy...@Heat Signature
Wendy@Hey.@Heat Signature
Marceline@Booboo...@Heat Signature
Booboo@Hello. Hello.@Heat Signature

Georgy@Hey.@Heat Signature
Marceline@We used to be in a gang together back in the underworld.@Heat Signature
Finn@Hmm. Yeah, that's pretty sweet. Hope y'all like getting your minds blown, cause it's showtime.@Heat Signature
Finn@What is wrong with this couch?@Heat Signature
Jake@Ehh, that made my teeth hurt.@Heat Signature
Marceline@Oh yeah. Sorry, I don't ever really sit on there. I just float usually. We... kinda all do.@Heat Signature
Finn@Aww, what? man, no fair.@Heat Signature
Marceline@Yeah, well, too bad you're not vampires. So, anyways, I...@Heat Signature
Finn@Wait! Hold on just a second.@Heat Signature
Finn@Marceline, we insist you turn us into vampires. Or ghosts, or whatever. We just wanna fly.@Heat Signature
Marceline@All right, all right. Fine.@Heat Signature
Finn and Jake@Yes!@Heat Signature
Wendy@Come on, Marceline! you're gonna turn these goofballs?@Heat Signature
Marceline@Don't worry, I've got something more fun in mind.@Heat Signature
Finn@Okay, Marceline, we're ready now.@Heat Signature
Marceline@Okay, hold that thought.@Heat Signature
Georgy@Huhuuuhhuh...@Heat Signature
Marceline@I'm gonna perform the biting ritual. You guys close your eyes and don't open them until I say so. If you do... your heads will EXPLODE! Okay, Finn. You first.@Heat Signature
Marceline@Bite.@Heat Signature
Marceline@Chomp.@Heat Signature
Marceline@Boop boop. Boop. Boop. Okey dokey. All done. How do you guys feel?@Heat Signature

Booboo@Don't you feel a little hungry...for blood?@Heat Signature
Finn@I felt it. Jake, do you feel it?@Heat Signature
Jake@Yeah, I could go for some blood.@Heat Signature
Finn@Oh no. Jake. Now we're gonna have to drink blood for all eternity.@Heat Signature
Jake@Yeah, what if we turn evil? I'll hafta start wearing cologne.@Heat Signature
Marceline@Relax, guys. You can satisfy your bloodlust without killing. Look. You just eat the color. Here, Jake. You try.@Heat Signature
Finn@Ugh. Come on.@Heat Signature
Jake@Sorry, bro. Oh, snap! I feel... stronger.@Heat Signature
Finn@Whooooa... Marceline, can we float now?@Heat Signature
Marceline@Mmm... Not yet. That's a really advanced power. First, you gotta go through vampire orientation.@Heat Signature
Georgy@Huhuuuhhuh...@Heat Signature
Marceline@Think you chumps can handle it?@Heat Signature
Finn and Jake@Oh, baby, yeah, baby, baby, baby, yeah, baby, yeah, yeah.@Heat Signature

Marceline@Ah! Hey!@Heat Signature
Marceline@You ready for the power of...invisibility?@Heat Signature
Finn@With all my heart.@Heat Signature
Marceline@Good. Now, spin!@Heat Signature
Marceline@Give it a whirl, Jake! Now chant, "INVISIBLE!INVISIBLE!"@Heat Signature
Finn and Jake@INVISIBLE!INVISIBLE!@Heat Signature
Marceline@Yup. It worked?@Heat Signature
Jake@We're invisible!@Heat Signature
Finn@You're invisible!@Heat Signature
Jake@Hey. Then how come we can see each other?@Heat Signature
Marceline@Because you guys become vampires at the same time. So you are forever linked.@Heat Signature
Finn and Jake@AWW YEAH!@Heat Signature
Booboo@Marceline...you're friends with some real morons.@Heat Signature
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, my glob, Melissa. Ever since Clara stopped eating meat, her skin looks so good. I mean, she still looks fat, but like, I can't say that junk to her face.@Heat Signature
Jake@Wow! LSP's a hobo!@Heat Signature
Finn@Let's mess with her.@Heat Signature
Lumpy Space Princess@I'm doing so awesome on my own. Like, right now, I found this can of beans.@Heat Signature
Lumpy Space Princess@Finn? Jake! Put down my stuff!@Heat Signature
Finn@She knows it's us.@Heat Signature
Jake@She must recognize our voices.@Heat Signature
Finn@Let's disguise them. We're invisible!@Heat Signature
Lumpy Space Princess@Melissa, I have to go. They got into my toilet paper. Melissa, I have to go!@Heat Signature
Lumpy Space Princess@Give it back, you guys!@Heat Signature

Georgy@What?@Heat Signature
Marceline@Finn, Jake. You guys okay?@Heat Signature
Finn@We're okay. It's all worth it.@Heat Signature
Georgy@See? They're fine.@Heat Signature
Wendy@When did you go all soft? You used to like teaching people about kicks.@Heat Signature
Georgy@Hey, guys, I think you're ready to learn how to float. All you have to do is jump off that ledge.@Heat Signature
Finn@Cool.@Heat Signature
Marceline@W-wait! There's more beginner lessons you need to learn before floating. Like... uh... the spooky vampire walk. See? Spoooooky... wooo!@Heat Signature
Finn@Heh heh. No way.@Heat Signature
Jake@We wanna fly!@Heat Signature
Marceline@You guys stop right now.@Heat Signature
Georgy@Marceline, chill out. It's going to be okay. We've got a plan. Now, get in your flying positions.@Heat Signature
Finn and Jake@VAMPIRES FOREVER!!! WOOO!@Heat Signature
Marceline@What are you guys waiting for? You said you had a plan.@Heat Signature
Wendy@We do. It's to let them die!@Heat Signature

Marceline@Hey, you guys need to stop trying to kill my friends!@Heat Signature
Booboo@They gotta die someday.@Heat Signature
Wendy@Hey! Let's invite them to our place! When they show up...@Heat Signature
Wendy, Booboo and Georgy@We'll suck their guts out through their brains!@Heat Signature
Finn@Did you see us?@Heat Signature
Wendy@Yeah, you guys were pretty amazing.@Heat Signature
Booboo@Hey, we're gonna throw a party... in honor of your new vampire skills.@Heat Signature
Finn@Holy snaps, that's awesome!@Heat Signature
Marceline@They're lying to you guys. They just wanna suck the guts out of the top of your head.@Heat Signature
Finn, Jake, and ghosts@What?@Heat Signature
Booboo@She's just jealous of you.@Heat Signature
Wendy@We'll see you at midnight at our place.@Heat Signature
Marceline@Guys, promise me you're going to that party.@Heat Signature
Finn@We're not gonna go.@Heat Signature
Marceline@You're not?@Heat Signature
Finn@Nah. I'm kinda tired from doing vampire stuff all day. We're just gonna chill.@Heat Signature
Marceline@Oh. Okay.@Heat Signature
Finn@Well, we're going back home.@Heat Signature
Jake@Peace.@Heat Signature
Finn@Number 25, Blood Drive. Hey guys, we're here! Wow! Look at you guys! That's awesome!@Heat Signature
Finn@Uh... Georgy, what's wrong? Jake, what's happening?@Heat Signature
Jake@I think they're testing our vampire abilities.@Heat Signature
Finn@Oh, sweet. VAMPIRE KICK!@Heat Signature
Georgy@Aw, come on. Will you knock it off already?@Heat Signature
Wendy@You know you're not even real vampires.@Heat Signature
Finn@Pssh. Then why am I flying, Wendy? Oh. Yo, man. I think Marceline tricked us.@Heat Signature
Jake@Yeah.@Heat Signature
Marceline@VAMPIRE KICK!!! Finn. Jake. I'm so sorry I got you into this. I should've never pranked you so perfectly.@Heat Signature
Finn@It's okay. You're here now to beat up those ghosts and save us.@Heat Signature
Marceline@Oh, no, vampires can't beat ghosts. It's sort of a Rock-Paper-Scissors thing. I just came to apologize.@Heat Signature
Finn@Aw, man. I can't believe we're gonna die just because we wanted to be comfortable watching Heat Signature.@Heat Signature
Georgy@Uh... did you guys say... Heat Signature?@Heat Signature
Commander@Have you located the enemy's heat signature, Private?@Heat Signature
Private@Yes, sir. But I also noticed something... strange. Something... I can't explain.@Heat Signature
Commander@Well, spit it out, man!@Heat Signature
Private@I... I... I can't seem to locate... our heat signature.@Heat Signature
Finn@This stink-ups mega bam-bam to the J-stop. Could we just go back to the brain-eating or whatever?@Heat Signature

Fight King@Then step forth beyond the Moonlight seal to bathe in blood and glory forever.@Morituri Te Salutamus
Finn@Nah. This is a trap.@Morituri Te Salutamus

Finn@Hmm. Okay, I have a plan. We'll do what the Fight King says, and defeat his ghosts to earn our freedom. You're gonna follow my plan, right?@Morituri Te Salutamus
Jake@Mmm-hmm. But, hey, if you replace me with a dummy, I could stay down here and dig for lava. Then I'd forge a molten hula-hoop.@Morituri Te Salutamus
Finn@That's an entirely different plan... than my plan. What's the hula-hoop for?@Morituri Te Salutamus

Finn@Pretty much.@Morituri Te Salutamus
Jake@Why didn't you say so?@Morituri Te Salutamus
Finn@Because you always bungle my plans. But, if you had bungled this one... I might have, for real, chopped your head off.@Morituri Te Salutamus
Jake@That's some funky junk, brother.@Morituri Te Salutamus
Finn@Hey, Jake, you notice how all these ghosts are walking in pairs?@Morituri Te Salutamus
Jake@Oh, yeah. I bet they're like us. Best bros who got trapped in that arena.@Morituri Te Salutamus
Finn@But now they're free!@Morituri Te Salutamus
Rag Wizard@Faster!@Memory of a Memory
Rag Wizard@Faster! She's in danger!@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Who is he talking about?@Memory of a Memory
Finn@I have no idea.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@What?! Then why am I running so hard?@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Because...@Memory of a Memory
Rag Wizard@Because she's in trouble!@Memory of a Memory
Finn and Jake@Who is?!@Memory of a Memory
Rag Wizard@Marceline!@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Faster, Jake!@Memory of a Memory
Jake@She's in trouble!@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Hey, wizard, how do you know Marceline?@Memory of a Memory
Rag Wizard@I'm her spirit animal.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Oh.@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Marceline! What's wrong with her?@Memory of a Memory
Rag Wizard@She accidentally cast a sleep spell on herself, and now she's trapped in eternal slumber.@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Tell us how to break the spell.@Memory of a Memory
Rag Wizard@I'll transport you into Marceline's mind where you will walk through her memories and find the memory core.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Then what?@Memory of a Memory
Rag Wizard@Find the memory of Marceline casting the sleep spell on herself. At your touch, you and the memory will be transported back to reality.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@But, like, if you know all this, why not just do it yourself?@Memory of a Memory
Rag Wizard@Entering a person's mind can be dangerous, and I don't have any arms. Just legs. Yeah, there we go... oh.@Memory of a Memory
Finn@What? What'd you do to my forehead?@Memory of a Memory
Rag Wizard@When you get close to the memory, your forehead will glow. Here, take this. It's a sack of magic powder. Sit on the couch and sprinkle the powder on your head.@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Like this?@Memory of a Memory
Rag Wizard@Yep, like that. Feel sleepy?@Memory of a Memory
Finn and Jake@Mmhm.@Memory of a Memory
Rag Wizard@Good. Sleep now. But know this! If you fail, Marceline will be trapped in eternal sleep... forever!@Memory of a Memory
Rag Wizard@And ever. And ever.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Did it work?@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Ugh, ah. I can't tell. I don't feel like I'm inside Marceline's memories.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Me neither. Huh?@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Whoa. Whoa!@Memory of a Memory
Finn@So... if we're in Marceline's memories, where's Marceline?@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Hmm... there she is! Hey, little Marcy.@Memory of a Memory
Young Marceline@Who are you guys?@Memory of a Memory
Finn@We're Finn and Jake.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@We're your friends!@Memory of a Memory
Young Marceline@Hambo is my only friend. See? You need another eyeball surgery, pal. Lucky for you, we found a donor. Eyeball! Nurse, hand me the string. Yes, doctor. It's our last piece. Hold still. I'm hurting you because I love you.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Ahem!@Memory of a Memory
Young Marceline@What are you guys still doing here?@Memory of a Memory
Finn@We're trying to wake you up.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Do you know where your memory core is?@Memory of a Memory
Young Marceline@Nope, but there might be anything behind that cellar door, and it rhymes with memory core!@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Ooo! Ooo! Could be jams and pickles down there! Weird. I think this door leads to a new memory; with food in it! Ooo, ice cream@Memory of a Memory
Finn@I want some! Huh?@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Come on, Finn!@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Yo, man.@Memory of a Memory
Hunson Abadeer@Wha?@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Don't eat those.@Memory of a Memory
Hunson Abadeer@Marceline!@Memory of a Memory
Teenage Marceline@Daddy, why?@Memory of a Memory
Finn@It's our treehouse. This must be when Marceline lived here.@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@I'm so glad we're doing this, Ash.@Memory of a Memory
Ash@Yeah, me too. Oh, hey, wait. Watch this--I've been practicing.@Memory of a Memory
Rose@Marceline! I love, I love.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Who's this guy supposed to be?@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Ash, I guess.@Memory of a Memory
Finn@This place reeks.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Yo, man, your thing is glowing.@Memory of a Memory
Finn@My what? Oh, my thing.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@We must be close to the core. I see another door over there. Come on.@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Wait a sec, Jake. It's that guy again.@Memory of a Memory
Ash@Hey, open your eyes, look at this, Mar-Mar. Check it out. It's my new wand. These cherry blossoms, look, look as close as you can, and they're real.@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@Wow. Awesome. Where'd you get the money for that thing?@Memory of a Memory
Ash@Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a Witch.@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@You what? Are you crazy? That was my favorite thing in the whole world!@Memory of a Memory
Ash@That's why it's so valuable, genius--for potions.@Memory of a Memory
Cherry Blossom Ghost@You're not, a genius. You're not, a genius.@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@That's the last straw, Ash! That's it! You're a psycho jerk, and you ruined my life.@Memory of a Memory
Ash@But--but not all of it!@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@IT'S OVER, YOU PSYCHO!!@Memory of a Memory
Jake@This way, Finn! Check out this whacked out memory crack! It's ba-nay-nay down here!@Memory of a Memory
Finn@The core!@Memory of a Memory
Jake@All these orbs must be her memories.@Memory of a Memory
Finn@How are we supposed to know which one to grab?@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Play hot-cold with your forehead!@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Alright. Hot or cold?@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Cold. Definitely cold.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Warmer. Warmer, warmer! Whoa, hot. Hot, hot, hot! That must be the one!@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Huh? Hey, you have arms.@Memory of a Memory
Ash@That's right, genius.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Huh?@Memory of a Memory
Finn@You lied to us.@Memory of a Memory
Ash@The important thing is... Marceline's awake.@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Marcie, Marcie! You're okay.@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@Quit touching my hair!@Memory of a Memory
Finn@You had a magic accident, and we saved you with some help from your wizard friend.@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@That's Ash.@Memory of a Memory
Finn and Jake@Ash?@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@He's not my friend; he's my boyfriend.@Memory of a Memory
Finn and Jake@What?!@Memory of a Memory
Ash@That's right, babe.@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@Ash, what's going on?@Memory of a Memory
Ash@Just picking up my girl for a night on the town; at my place.@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@That's sweet.@Memory of a Memory
Finn and Jake@What?!@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@Oh, grow up you guys. I'm going to go freshen up.@Memory of a Memory
Ash@That's a relief.@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@Oh, Ash.@Memory of a Memory
Finn@What?@Memory of a Memory
Ash@Don't you guys get it? I outbrained you. That wasn't the memory of a sleep spell you brought me. That memory was our break-up!@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@It's over, you psycho!!@Memory of a Memory
Ash@That's enough of that?@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Oh, no!@Memory of a Memory
Finn@What?@Memory of a Memory
Ash@Yup. Come on, Mar-Mar, let's go.@Memory of a Memory
Finn@No, Marceline!@Memory of a Memory
Ash@Ashicus Flyicus.@Memory of a Memory
Finn@They're gone, man. He took her!@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Don't worry, Finn! I got the scent. Ah. Follow me.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@I could smell them in there. So what's the plan?@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Um. Okay, you take that shovel and keep banging it against that shed until Ash comes out to see what's happening. Then I'll sneak in, and I'll rescue Marceline.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Nice.@Memory of a Memory
Tiny Goblin@My house! What's happening? No, don't hurt me!@Memory of a Memory
Jake@No, no, sorry.@Memory of a Memory
Jake@Shh, shh, wait!@Memory of a Memory
Tiny Goblin@Help, somebody help me!@Memory of a Memory
Ash@What's all this hullabaloo?!@Memory of a Memory
Tiny Goblin@Help! Help!@Memory of a Memory
Ash@Hey, hold it, you, get back here!@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@Finn? Finn, what are you doing? You can't be here! Ash doesn't like me hanging out with mere mortals.@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Yeah, okay. Sorry Marceline, I'll go. I just gotta show you something first.@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@Hello? Finn?@Memory of a Memory
Finn@Hey, there you are.@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@Finn, what's going on? What is this place?@Memory of a Memory
Finn@It's my old house. That magic powder--it put you in my memories. Me and Jake were in yours before, but Ash tricked us into stealing your memory of you breaking up with him. But it's okay because I saw the memory. Now I have a memory of your memory in my memory. See?@Memory of a Memory
Ash@Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a witch.@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@It's over, you psycho!!@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@Finn, I think I'd like to wake up now.@Memory of a Memory
Finn@You gonna be okay, Marceline?@Memory of a Memory
Marceline@Yeah. Thanks, Finn, I...@Memory of a Memory
Ash@Yo, Mar-Mar. What—What's with the chump? C'mon, I said no chumps. Ash gets hungies at eight o' clock. You need to get back in the kitchen and make me din-ner.@Memory of a Memory
Ash@I want a turkey sandwich with to-ma-to.@Memory of a Memory
Ash@Also pickles.@Memory of a Memory
Ash@Ohh...I can't see...Somebody call my mom!@Memory of a Memory
Ice King@Good morning, Breakfast Princesses.@Hitman
Breakfast Princess@Huh? Sis, give me the phone. Oh, hey, Finn. I got another Ice King situation here. Oh, yeah? That would be great! Thanks.@Hitman
Finn@Ice King?! How many times have we warned you about using love potion?@Hitman
Ice King@That's why I'm using honey.@Hitman
Jake@Man, who cares if it's honey? You stink anyways.@Hitman
Finn@Yeah, you stink so much I'm gonna ground you for a week!@Hitman
Ice King@What? You can't do that!@Hitman
Finn@You're grounded for two weeks!@Hitman
Ice King@You're grounded for two weeks!@Hitman
Finn@Three weeks.@Hitman
Jake@Oh, snaps!@Hitman
Ice King@Why? I didn't do anything.@Hitman
Finn@Four weeks?@Hitman
Ice King@Fine. But I'm only gonna do it for a week.@Hitman
Finn@That just grounded you for four weeks.@Hitman
Jake@Oh, dang!@Hitman
Ice King@Okay. What's up with the peace sign?@Hitman
Jake@Oh, nah, I'm just trying to show you how many weeks ya got.@Hitman
Finn@Get outta here, bubble-butt!@Hitman
Jake@Awesome.@Hitman
Ice King@This is so unfair! They're the ones who should be grounded. Not me! I'm so mad! I could just hit them! If only I could hit them without leaving the castle. H...I...T...M...A...N. Ooh!@Hitman
Ice King@Perfect. Dear Mr. Scorcher, I would like you to hit two people. Neat name by the way. Love, the Ice King.@Hitman
Ice King@Whoa, you are fast. And quiet. And very good at dramatic silence. I like it. Alright, so, how do we do this? We shake hands or... Oh-ho, paperwork! Finn and Jake. Whoosh! A-ha, there he is. Huh? What's he doing? What the—?! I hired a hitman, not a fireman!@Hitman
Jake@Dude, you see my masterpiece coming together, right?@Hitman
Finn@Mine's whack.@Hitman
Jake@Well, put some meat in there!@Hitman
Finn@Huh. What kind of meat is that?@Hitman
Jake@That's Meat Man's meat.@Hitman
Finn@Do you think it hurts Meat Man when he gives us his meat?@Hitman
Jake@I don't know. I can't read his mind.@Hitman
Jake@No!@Hitman
Ice King@You guys, I—@Hitman
Finn@What do you think "grounded" means?!@Hitman
Jake@It's wasted, man.@Hitman
Finn@Oh, great. Now see what you did to my buddy? So help me, Ice King.@Hitman
Ice King@Okay, okay. Goll.@Hitman
Finn@It's alright, buddy. We can make another.@Hitman
Ice King@Sheesh, this Scorcher guy's got some weird ideas about hitting.@Hitman
Ice King@Hey, there you are! What's that? I already signed that. I thought I told you to hit them, not burn them alive! You big dummy! Goll! It's almost like you want to kill them! Lucky for them, I stopped the fire! You know what happens when you're burned alive?! Your eyeballs explode! Bleh! Hey wha—?@Hitman
Finn@Punch, punch, punch!@Hitman
Jake@Rainicorn, don't eat 'im.@Hitman
Ice King@Ice wind! Blow! Blow! Blow!@Hitman
Jake@Meat Man. Meat Man, I'm sorry, Meat Man, I didn't mean it, man.@Hitman
Ice King@Finn and Jake, I am just a dream. I was never here...@Hitman
Ice King@Okay, mister, you are really trying my patience. How clear can I be?! All I want you to do is hit them. On the shoulder or something. Are you even listening? Oh, I get it. Here's double the grease to not kill Finn and Jake. You trying to hustle me, Scorcher? Okay, I'll play this game. How about this prized piece for your pad? No! Okay, how about these bad boys? Night-vision x-ray goggles. For when you have a lady house-guest. Oh, come on! At least renegotiate the target! You can destroy my least favorite princesses. What about Lumpy Space Princess? Ghost Princess? I can't even hold her with my love mitts. Aw, geez! Uh... Oh! A—A leg cramp! In my leg! Ow, ow, ow. Oh, this is so embarrassing. I'll be right back! Ow, ow, ow! Huh. Think, baby, come on. Ah! Alright, let's hit the hitman, right? There's gotta be a— Ah!@Hitman
Ice King@Blastronaut. #1 solution for all Hitman problems. Sheesh, 99.95? That's nuts. Scorcher.@Hitman
Ice King@Sweet!@Hitman
Ice King@No! Come back, you wussy! Ooh, that was weird. Was that your friend, or something? Look, a super model! Look, a hover-board! Look, the apocalypse! Someone got hit in the boing-loins! Hit in the boing-loins! Boing-loins! Boing-loins. Somebody got hit in them. Peace out!@Hitman
Ice King@Freakin' butt! Butt, butt, butt!@Hitman
Jake@Hey, Finn, you awake yet?@Hitman
Finn@I'm trying.@Hitman
Jake@I had a dream about Meat Man.@Hitman
Finn@Oh, yeah?@Hitman
Jake@I think I'm gonna stop eating Meat Man.@Hitman
Finn@You're grounded!@Hitman
Ice King@I know, but shush!@Hitman
Ice King@Okay, I hired a guy to kill you by accident.@Hitman
Finn and Jake@What?!@Hitman
Ice King@I thought he was going to just hit you in the gut and make you spit up your lunch. Well, I froze him in ice, but I think he's free now 'cause he's made out of fire. Or he commands fire, maybe?@Hitman
Jake@Good job. Good job, the Ice King.@Hitman
Finn@Oh, my life!@Hitman
Jake@C'mon, man, let's get outta here!@Hitman
Finn@Jake, do something. He's getting close!@Hitman
Ice King@You alive?@Hitman
Jake@Uh, I think so.@Hitman
Ice King@Whew! That was close.@Hitman
Jake@Uh, hey, guys? I don't think this ice dome is gonna last long.@Hitman
Finn@What do we do?@Hitman
Ice King@Ooh, got it! I'm gonna kill you guys!@Hitman
Jake@Hey, I'll kill you!@Hitman
Ice King@No, wait a minute, you two. I won't actually kill you. I'm just gonna lower your body temperatures so you seem dead. And after we fool that fool outside, I'll warm you up, good as new.@Hitman
Jake@No way, man! You already messed up enough stuff. You're probably gonna kill us, too.@Hitman
Finn@Yeah, we don't trust you!@Hitman
Ice King@You'll thank me later.@Hitman
Ice King@Stop! Time out! You don't need to do this anymore! Look! They're dead! I killed them myself! Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead! They're dead. No pulses.@Hitman
Ice King@So, uh, looks like, you can go home now.@Hitman
Ice King@Oh, yes, of course. There.@Hitman
Ice King@Oh, glad all that's over. Hey, guys, guess what? You're grounded. Underneath my butt!@Hitman
Princess Bubblegum@Finn? Finn? Finn! Where are you? I need you to try this!@Too Young
Finn@I'll be there in a sec!@Too Young

Princess Bubblegum@No... He is rightful ruler under kingdom law. It's complicated. I created Lemongrab.@Too Young
Princess Bubblegum@He was the first of my experiments gone wrong...@Too Young

Finn@Maybe if we... set his butt on fire.@Too Young
Princess Bubblegum@No, Finn... There's only one way. I just didn't want to have to do it. If I change myself back to my real age, I can reclaim the throne.@Too Young
Finn@What? No! I mean... you can do that?@Too Young
Finn@Then... why did you wait so long?@Too Young
Princess Bubblegum@Because being 13 again is... Bloobaloobie!@Too Young
Finn@Hm?@Too Young
Princess Bubblegum@While being 18 is all plock dumps and wagglezags... I never really get to act like a kid. But, it's okay. Really. My people need me, and that comes first!@Too Young
Finn@Yeaaah...@Too Young
Princess Bubblegum@First thing we need is more candy flesh to increase my biomass. But I need my lab equipment to engineer it.@Too Young
Peppermint Butler@Not necessarily, milady!@Too Young
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, thank you! Thank you, all! Okay... Next we need a bonding agent.@Too Young
Finn@Princess? I think I can help.@Too Young

Finn@Are you ready, Princess?@Too Young
Princess Bubblegum@Yes, Finn. But... first, I just want to say how much fun I've had hanging out with you.@Too Young
Finn@Me, too!@Too Young

Finn@Oh- yeah, yeah... Sorry...@Too Young
Princess Bubblegum@Such a silly boy.@Too Young
Finn@Hello?@Too Young
Jake@Hey, man! What's the status?@Too Young
Finn@Bad news, man... I... I got dumped.@Too Young
Jake@Awww. I'm sorry, Finn. But look, man. Lemme share with you a little secret on how to win the heart of a princess. It's not easy, but ya have to be persistent. You might have to defeat a demon lord, and warp through several worlds.@Too Young
Jake@But once you do, you walk up the wizard stairs, and produce your magic key you got in a water world and unlock the chamber door. Then, walk right up to the princess, and give her a smooch.@Too Young
Jake@Yesss! Does that make sense?@Too Young
Finn@Yeah, man. I see what you're sayin'. Thanks, Jake.@Too Young
Jake@Mmm-hmm.@Too Young
Finn@Go up the wizard steps.@Too Young
Lumpy Space Messenger@Sir! My sir! A message from their majesties.@The Monster
Finn & Jake@King and Queen Lumpy Space!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Queen@We can't find our baby girl!@The Monster

Lumpy Space King@No more tears, Boobly-Bear. Please, take her these sandwiches we made. She loves these sandwiches. Thank you, boys.@The Monster
Finn@Whoo!@The Monster
Finn@Dude, I know where Lumpy Space Princess is. She's in the woods eating beans.@The Monster
Jake@Mmhmm! This is gonna be easy as... uh... mm...@The Monster
Finn@Easy as childbirth!@The Monster
Jake@Yeah, okay.@The Monster
Fat Villager@Please, please help me. A monster is terrorizing our village and has eaten up all the crops.@The Monster
Finn@Why were you up here in this tree?@The Monster
Fat Villager@I thought I saw some food, and I was hiding from the monster. You must help.@The Monster
Finn@Hmm. I guess we can help this guy real quick and then get back to LSP.@The Monster
Jake@Where's your village?@The Monster
Fat Villager@Umm, I don't remember.@The Monster
Fat Villager@Howard remembers. Hey! It's Howard! Howard! You remember where the village is?@The Monster
Howard@Yeah, I marked it on the map, but it's only half.@The Monster
Howard@Well, we're all ready.@The Monster
Fat Villager #2@We can't leave yet.@The Monster
Fat Villagers@Aw.@The Monster
Howard@Alright, now we're ready.@The Monster
Fat Villager #3@What's in the basket?@The Monster
Jake@Sammiches!@The Monster
Fat Villagers@Food! Food!@The Monster
Finn@Wait! You can't eat this food! It's not ours to give!@The Monster
Fat Villagers@Aw.@The Monster
Finn@Now, show us the way to your town.@The Monster
Fat Villager #4@Too tired from hunger. Carry me?@The Monster
Finn@Okay.@The Monster
Fat Villager #1@The monster lives in that windmill, but we're too scared to go near it.@The Monster
Finn & Jake@Nothing scares us!@The Monster
Jake@Be alert. Anything could pop out of there and rip our faces off.@The Monster
Finn@Whoo.@The Monster
Jake@Be careful, Finn.@The Monster
Finn@It's you!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Finn, what the junk?@The Monster
Jake@It's you!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, sandwiches!@The Monster
Jake@LSP, what the heck are you doin' here?@The Monster
Finn@Are you in here making out with the monster?@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@No... I am the monster.@The Monster
Jake@Whaaaaat?@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@It's a long story.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@It all started at my lumpin' parents' house.@The Monster
Lumpy Space King@Daughter?@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Yeah?@The Monster
Lumpy Space Queen@How are the sandwiches?@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@They're lumpin' delicious, Mom.@The Monster
Lumpy Space King@You know, you could enjoy your mom's sandwiches every day if you came back more often.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@No. You can have them delivered to me at my apartment.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Queen@We want you to move back home, sweetheart.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@What?! You invited me here under false pretenses?!@The Monster
Lumpy Space King@Wait, sweetheart. We're just worried about you.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Ha! Y'all don't think I can make it on my own? I'll show you! I'm running away!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@I stormed out and left Lumpy Space forever.@The Monster
Jake@Oh, and then you found this windmill.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@No. Something else happened first. Keep listening.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@I was so cold, and I was so very hungry.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Uh! Oh, Glob! Maybe I can... make a shelter out of these nuts!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@It's not fair.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@I was rescued by a family of wolves. The mama wolf was all like, "We must take care of her, as if she were our own." And Papa Wolf was all like, "This is a special child who needs special love because she's gonna be great when she grows up."@The Monster
Finn@So these were talking wolves?@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@No, they were normal wolves. I knew what they were thinking because of their body language. Stop interrupting, Finn.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@I found a home where I could act like myself.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@They took care of me.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@I knew that if my parents could see me now, they'd be jealous of how lumpin' awesome I am.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, my Glob!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@But then, the drama started.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Stephanie, Sue, can you guys keep a secret? Okay, here's the secret I just saw Jessica making out with Mark... behind Tony's back! Stephanie, are you even listening? 'Cause I'm kinda freaking out right now! Tony's gonna come back from hunting any minute now, and—@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Hi, Tony! Oh, my Glob. Guys, what are we gonna— oh.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@So, should we say something to Tony?@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@You guys! TONY, JESSICA'S CHEATING ON YOU!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, my Glob. Oh, my Glob. Oh, my Glob.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Look, I'm sorry. I know it's none of my business. I know, I—@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Because I think Tony has a right to know, Stephanie!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Nuh-uh, Miranda, I do not like Tony.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@No, Jessica! Don't cheat on Tony with me!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Ah! Oh, Glob! Oh, no! Aah! Oh, Glob.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@I came upon a tribe of villagers.@The Monster
Female Fat Villager@Monster!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, I'm so hungry!@The Monster
Male Fat Villager@Monster!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Ah!@The Monster
Another Fat Villager@Monster!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Anyway, then I found this windmill, and whenever I get hungry, I dress up like the monster and I go eat all the villagers' crops.@The Monster
Finn@LSP, you're stealing!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Don't say that. You're makin' me feel bad.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Thanks, Finn.@The Monster
Finn@LSP, if you wanna feel better, you should apologize to the farmers and make amends.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Really?@The Monster
Jake@Yeah, that'll work.@The Monster
Fat Villager@Monster! Monster! Monster! Monster!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@No. No, wait!@The Monster
Fat Villagers@Monster! Monster!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@I'm not a monster! I was just pretending to be a monster.@The Monster
Fat Villagers@Uh?@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@I'm sorry that you're starving because I ate all of your crops, even though you're all still really fat, and I probably helped you lose some weight.@The Monster
Fat Villager@Did she just call us fat?@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Don't get all bent out of shape! I'm just being honest!@The Monster
Finn@LSP!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@What?@The Monster
Finn@That apology was terrible!@The Monster
Fat Villager@Look, the monster eats while it apologizes! Let's kill it!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Please don't kill me!@The Monster
Fat Villager@We have to!@The Monster
Finn@Well, you don't have to.@The Monster
Jake@Yeah, you could just let her go.@The Monster
Fat Villager@If we let her go, she'll keep eating our crops, and we'll starve!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Why don't you just get your parents to buy you more crops?@The Monster
Fat Villager@We are parents! Those crops were for our children!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@You guys are parents? Just like my parents... @The Monster
Finn@LSP, are you okay?@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Yeah, Finn, I'm great. Here, I want you to have these sandwiches.@The Monster
Fat Villagers@Sandwiches.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Yeah, they're really good. They're made with a lot of love.@The Monster
Finn@It's working!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@I saved the village!@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@And that's how I saved the village!@The Monster
Lumpy Space King@Well, we're just glad you're home.@The Monster
Lumpy Space Princess@Whatever.@The Monster
Lumpy Space King@And thank you, Finn and Jake.@The Monster
Finn@No problem.@The Monster
Jake@Yeah, we didn't really do that much.@The Monster
Finn@Wha—?! Jake, I told you to stop staring at me right at the time when I wake up.@Still
Jake@I'm staring because I can't move my head.@Still
Jake@No, really, I can't move.@Still
Finn@I can't move either.@Still
Jake@What's happening?!@Still
Finn@What? What was that? Who goes there?@Still
Jake@Hey! Who is that?@Still
Finn@Jake, use your peripheral vision!@Still
Jake@Ooooh... Ice King!@Still
Ice King@I shouldn't be laughing, I'm sorry. Oh, I know, I'll do the opposite. Oh, boohoo. Ah, this is weird.@Still
Finn@What did you do to us, Ice King?@Still
Ice King@Whoa, whoa. I didn't "do" anything to you, okay? C'mon, guys, I'm your friend.@Still
Jake@So why can't we move?@Still
Ice King@Ooh, because I froze you... with this.@Still
Finn@Freezing Potion A.@Still
Ice King@I sprayed it on you while you slept.@Still
Gunter@Wenk! Wenk!@Still
Ice King@No! Gunter, no! This one likes to break bottles, don't ya? Tuck-ety tuck! Let's move to the living room.@Still
Jake@Why are you doing this, Ice King?@Still
Ice King@Why? Oh, because I love you guys. But you don't love me, do ya?@Still
Jake@You tried to kill us, like, four times.@Still
Ice King@I only try to kill you 'cause you're princess-blocking me all the time! Anyway, now that you're frozen, we can bond and stuff. And the sooner we do, the sooner I can spray you with this.@Still
Finn@Unfreezing Potion A?@Still
Ice King@Ah, I underlined the "un" so I wouldn't mix 'em up.@Still
Jake@Just unfreeze us now, man.@Still
Finn@Yeah, 'cause we're already friends.@Still
Ice King@We are?@Still
Jake@Mm-hmm.@Still
Ice King@What's my favorite color?@Still
Finn@Uh, yellow? Orange? Blue—no, no, lavender! Lavender! Yeah!@Still
Jake@Um, ooh, uh... rainbow?@Still
Ice King@You don't love me. I know a lot about you guys. Jake, you don't put ice in your drink because you have sensitive teeth.@Still
Jake@Wha—?@Still
Ice King@And Finn, your favorite food is meatloaf.@Still
Finn@How did you—?@Still
Ice King@And Jake, sometimes you don't cry because you're afraid of real emotion. It's okay. Let it out. You don't love me— Bad penguin!@Still
Gunter@Wenk!@Still
Finn@You lock your bottles?@Still
Ice King@Huh, in this economy? Ah, I'm gonna go make some lemonade.@Still
Jake@Don't touch my lemons, Ice King! Ice King!@Still
Finn@Jake, look!@Still
Jake@Gunter! No, Gunter! No!@Still
Finn@No, Gunter, no!@Still
Gunter@Wenk!@Still
Finn@No, Gunter! No!@Still
Jake@No! Gunter! No!@Still
Finn@Gunter, stop!@Still
Gunter@Wenk, wenk!@Still
Jake@What're we gonna do?!@Still
Finn@When someone loses one sense, their other senses are enhanced—like a blind man who can smell and hear really well. I'm gonna try using my now-enhanced brain sense to make contact with an Astral Beast who will help us.@Still
Jake@What?@Still
Finn@Whee! Haha! Whee! Astral Beast, come to me!@Still
Finn@Come to me, Astral Beast...@Still
Ice King@I've got lemonade! You want some, Jake?@Still
Ice King@Huh? Gunter... No, Gunter! No bottles. Look at me.@Still
Gunter@Wenk!@Still
Ice King@What am I gonna do with you? You're going to have to wear a leash. This should keep you out of trouble. Now, our first bonding activity will be walking in each other's shoes—so to speak. To better understand each other's perspectives, we're going to dress up like each other. Me first!@Still
Ice King@It's adventure time! I'll save you, Princess! Let's have babies, Princess, and let's teach them to be good babies! Oh, Princess, sure, I'll kiss you. I'm a hero. Hey Finn, don't you think it's weird there's two Finns? Finn? Not talking? Now, I'm gonna dress like Jake.@Still
Jake@Noooo! No, no, no, no, no!@Still
Ice King@Okay, okay! We'll bond in another way.@Still
Ice King@So, I wanted to show you something telling of my soul. I take artful black and white photographs of my penguins' body parts. Photography is art; let's see some art. Okay, first one. See how Gunter is staring into the camera? He's saying, "Here I am. Look at me. Accept me." Okay, second one. This is a haunting image of a penguin's flipper. Look at how it penetrates the negative space. Oh yes, this one is very—@Still
Jake@I can't take this any more! Dang it, Finn! What are you doing in there?@Still
Finn@Astral Beast! Where are you? You come here NOW! Wheee...!@Still
Ice King@...Yeah, I've thought about it a lot, and having a little gallery show might be nice. A little cheese, a little cider... could be nice, y'know? Maybe bring a veggie plate? I think people would appreciate that.@Still
Jake@Key! Gunter. Gunter. Psst! Pssssst. Come here, Gunter.@Still
Ice King@This next one is very rewarding...@Still
Jake@Grab it, Gunter. Pick it up! Pick it up!! What are you waiting for? Just grab it!@Still
Gunter@Wenk. Wenk, wenk. Wenk, wenk, wenk, wenk, wenk.@Still
Jake@Gunter! Come back.@Still
Ice King@Gunter!@Still
Gunter@Weeenk.@Still
Ice King@You are being naughty, Gunter. You've interrupted my thing. Now you stay right here and go to sleep. Sleep. Aw. So cute. Alright, back to art.@Still
Jake@Gunter. Gunter, wake up. Go... get... the... key. Consarn it, Gunter!@Still
Ice King@Okay, time for a break. Who wants lemonade? Ooh, don't want to lose this. Gunter! Jake! No! You're bonding without me.@Still
Gunter@Wenk.@Still
Ice King@It's for your own good, sweetie. Now then.@Still
Jake@Wait, you're sleeping up here?!@Still
Ice King@Well... not before our next bonding activity late-night gab session! Do you want to talk about girls? Do you have a crush on anyone?@Still
Jake@Uh, yeah, my girlfriend? Lady Rainicorn?@Still
Ice King@Ohhhhhh! Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. Know who I have a crush on? Princess Bubblegum.@Still
Jake@You don't say.@Still
Ice King@Oh, I do. I've liked her for quite some time. Feels weird to say it out loud.@Still
Jake@What? He fell asleep with his eyes open. Finn! Finn, snap out of it!@Still
Finn@Astral Beast! WHERE ARE YOU? Show yourself! Why not? Does this dance please you, Astral Beast? Does this please you?!@Still
Finn@THIS IS IIIIT!@Still
Finn@The Astral Beast cometh.@Still
Ice King@Who's "hungie"? Jake, you "hungie"?@Still
Jake@I'm hungry.@Still
Ice King@Alright, fair enough. Well, how 'bout I make us some omelettes?@Still
Jake@That sounds pretty good, actually.@Still
Ice King@I'm gonna put my foot in it. Eating a part of me will bring us closer together. I'll be inside of you!@Still
Jake@Dude, you're back!@Still
Finn@Yup. I just got back from the Astral Plane!@Still
Jake@Where's your Astral Beast?@Still
Finn@It's on its way. It's gonna be awesome.@Still
Jake@What kind of beast?@Still
Finn@Uh, I'm not sure. I couldn't see it in the Astral Plane. But I heard it. It sounded really intense. Maybe a gorilla?@Still
Jake@A gorilla, huh?@Still
Finn@Aw, junk! Did I summon butterflies?! I'm the worst.@Still
Jake@Hey, come on now, you're not the worst.@Still
Finn@Yeah, I am.@Still
Jake@No, you're not! You're the best!@Still
Finn@...at being the worst.@Still
Finn@What are you doing?@Still
Jake@I'm using my enhanced brain sense to tell your astral beast to slap some sense into you.@Still
Finn@Oh. That's cool. I deserve it.@Still
Jake@No... you... don't!@Still
Ice King@Well, I don't want to use too much foot. It'll overpower the eggs. Take away from the omelette. Huh? Aah!@Still
Ice King@Finn! and Jake! and a bunch of butterflies! and a sword!@Still
Ice King@What do you want from me?@Still
Finn@What do we wa—? We want you to unfreeze us, you lunatic!@Still
Ice King@No! We're not friends yet. You haven't eaten my omelette.@Still
Finn@Friends don't eat each other, Ice King. That's not how friends work. Now unlock this bottle and unfreeze us.@Still
Ice King@Oh, alright. I don't know how you're doing this, but it is impressive.@Still
Ice King@Wait a minute... which bottle is thi—? I think they brought me the wrong bottle. Gunter's still upstairs. Gunter! Gunter! Gunter! Gunter!!@Still
Finn@Jake.@Wizard Battle
Finn@Wizard Battle is starting soon!@Wizard Battle
Jake@I know! We got here six hours early, you dork! Just wake me up when they start selling hot dogs. Whoa! What do you know!@Wizard Battle
Finn@The wizards are arriving!@Wizard Battle
Finn@Whoo-hoo! Yeah!!!@Wizard Battle
Grand Master Wizard@Ladies and gentlemen...@Wizard Battle
Grand Master Wizard@I am the Grand Master Wizard of Ceremonies. And now, the rules. Contestants will fight each other with spells from the eight schools of magic. No science, Science Whyzard! No weapons, Weapon Head! To enter Wizard Battle, you must be a wizard!@Wizard Battle
Finn@Whoo, wizard only allowed! Whoo. Whoo. Wh-... Oh, what? Ice King!@Wizard Battle
Jake@Boo!@Wizard Battle
Finn@You're a contestant?!@Wizard Battle
Ice King@Mm-hmm. You guys come here to watch me win?@Wizard Battle
Finn@Phshoo, you're gonna lose, man.@Wizard Battle
Jake@You're a loser.@Wizard Battle
Ice King@Ha! I'm not gonna lose! I've got a foolproof plan for winning. I'm gonna cheat.@Wizard Battle
Grand Master Wizard@And now L's and G's, witness the unveiling of this tournaments grand prize, A kiss from Princess Bubblegum! On the mouth!@Wizard Battle
Lady Wizard #1@Boooo. Boo.@Wizard Battle
Brain Wizard@Hmm. Is it an open mouth kiss?@Wizard Battle
Grand Master Wizard@No!@Wizard Battle
Brain Wizard@Then I choose to exit the battle.@Wizard Battle
Grand Master Wizard@No one is allowed to exit Wizard Battle! The doors are shut. The sky barrier is in place. All of you will kiss the princess or die in battle.@Wizard Battle
Ice King@Ooh, I just can't wait to taste that sweet Bubblegum.@Wizard Battle
Finn@Jake, we gotta enter the contest and stop Ice King.@Wizard Battle
Jake@But we're not wizards, man. What about the sanctity and honor of Wizard Battle?@Wizard Battle
Finn@I'd rather sanctify PB's lips.@Wizard Battle
Jake@Ooooh! You don't care about the Ice King. You just wanna kiss Princess Bubblegum.@Wizard Battle
Finn@No! I wanna save the princess!@Wizard Battle
Jake@Mm-hmm. Yeah, you do.@Wizard Battle
Finn@I do!@Wizard Battle
Jake@Yeah, you do.@Wizard Battle
Finn@Oh, shush!@Wizard Battle
Finn@Now, where's the Ice King.@Wizard Battle
Jake@Over there!@Wizard Battle
Ice King@Oh, yeah.@Wizard Battle
Finn@We need a plan, man.@Wizard Battle
Jake@Okay. When the wizards start to battle, let's go hide behind that rock.@Wizard Battle
Grand Master Wizard@By the rays of the setting sun, the battle of wizards has begun!@Wizard Battle
Jake@Looks like everyone had the same plan.@Wizard Battle
Finn@What are they waiting for?@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@The opposites.@Wizard Battle
Finn@Huh?@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@The wizards with opposite powers will take each other on first.@Wizard Battle
Finn@And are you a wizard?@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@Yes. My name is Abracadaniel.@Wizard Battle
Finn@Hi, Abracadaniel. My name is, uh, Magic... Fist.@Wizard Battle
Jake@Whoa. This kid looks like a wimp.@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@Who's that?@Wizard Battle
Finn@He's my, uh, magic second head.@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@Well, he's right. I only entered this contest 'cause I thought the prize would be money. But it's just a kiss!@Wizard Battle
Finn@You mean, you don't care about kissing PB?@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@Blegh, no way. If I was the winner, I would turn my face so our lips wouldn't touch and I would push Princess away. Turn and push, turn and push, turn and push...@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@...turn and push, turn and push. Well, I'm going back to my cave to wait for someone to kill me. Goodbye.@Wizard Battle
Finn@Wait! Abracadanny, don't you worry about a thing. I'm gonna protect you.@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@You will?@Wizard Battle
Finn@Yeah, man. Also, I have an idea for how you can help me save PB's lips.@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@Oh, okay.@Wizard Battle
Ice King@Yeaah!@Wizard Battle
Finn@Cheating!@Wizard Battle
Finn@He's using a weapon!@Wizard Battle
Jake@Why isn't the Grand Master Wizard seeing this?@Wizard Battle
Ice King@Nun-chucks vanish! Boo yah!@Wizard Battle
Finn@Now's my chance to stop him.@Wizard Battle
Finn@Huwahh?!@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@Rock Wizard!@Wizard Battle
Rock Wizard@Arrgghh! Come to me, meteor shower! Rock Wizard compels you!@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@Cantrip!@Wizard Battle
Rock Wizard@Huh?@Wizard Battle
Finn@No! Jake, two o' clock!@Wizard Battle
Finn@Okay, now to stop the Ice Kiiing...?@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@My body is squishy. That's how I survived.@Wizard Battle
Finn@Whoa! That's turbo amazing!@Wizard Battle
Finn@Stay close to me, Abracadaniel.@Wizard Battle
Cyclo@What?! You turned me pink, bro!@Wizard Battle
Grand Master Wizard@Three wizards remain. Time to get real. I wanna see some crazy wiz biz!@Wizard Battle
Ice King@Wiz biz! Wiz biz! Oh, I can almost taste those sweet lips.@Wizard Battle
Finn@Quick, listen! Now's the time for you to help me.@Wizard Battle
Ice King@Hey, guys. Guys? What are you whispering? Come on! I gotta a surprise for yous fools.@Wizard Battle
Ice King@Yeah. That's right. Just a little closer. Ooh, what's in here? In my little sleevey hole?@Wizard Battle
Finn@Watch out, man.@Wizard Battle
Ice King@Whoo!@Wizard Battle
Finn@You got this, Danny boy!@Wizard Battle
Ice King@My nun-chucks! Nooo!!@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@Yes! I did it! I really did it. I'm a true wizard.@Wizard Battle
Ice King@I have powers too, you butts! Yahh! Ice sword! Ice Shield!@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@Abracadaniel!@Wizard Battle
Ice King@Wha? What you say? B'oh!@Wizard Battle
Finn@Good job, Danny. You're not a wimp anymore. You should feel pretty good.@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@I do. I feel real good.@Wizard Battle
Finn@I'm gonna forfeit now. I only wanted to stop the Ice King.@Wizard Battle
Jake@Uh-uh.@Wizard Battle
Finn@I forfeit! I forfeit, everyone!@Wizard Battle
Finn@Meow.@Wizard Battle
Jake@Whoa.@Wizard Battle
Grand Master Wizard@Abracadaniel wins! You are the greatest wizard in Ooo!@Wizard Battle
Abracadaniel@Oh, w-w-well thank you, Grand Master Wizard. I guess through this trial I have become a great wizard. I, I came here with no self-esteem and no chances, a will-o-wisp of a boy, but I walk out this arena a man. A confident man! Who deserves a kiss from a princess!@Wizard Battle
Finn@NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!@Wizard Battle
Grand Master Wizard@It appears you have knocked out Abracadaniel using the most shameful of all magic, a power shriek. But since you are the last wizard, you are the winner of Wizard Battle. Go get ready for your kiss, champ.@Wizard Battle
Jake@Wow, man.@Wizard Battle
Finn@What?@Wizard Battle
Jake@I've never heard you scream like that before. You were all like, "Nooo! No one kisses her but me!"@Wizard Battle
Finn@Yeah, okay! I want to kiss her, alright? You got me! The big secret is out! Okay, Jake. I like Princess Bubblegum! ARE YOU HAPPY, JAKE?!@Wizard Battle
Finn@Whoa, Jake. Don't cry, man. I'm not really mad at you.@Wizard Battle
Finn@I'm just sick of having to hide my feelings all the driz. It's exhausting.@Wizard Battle
Jake@Then stop hiding you feelings, man! Go out there, and smooch it up!@Wizard Battle
Finn@Heh heh. Yeah, alright, man.@Wizard Battle
Grand Master Wizard@You ready in there?@Wizard Battle
Finn@Yeah, I'm coming!@Wizard Battle
Finn@Ooh, whoa!@Wizard Battle
Finn@Oh, dag.@Wizard Battle
Princess Bubblegum@What's going on here?@Wizard Battle
Finn@Uh, Ice King was cheating his way through Wizard Battle using nun-chucks, so Jake and I faked being wizards to save you from having to kiss him and we uh, I dishonored Wizard Battle.@Wizard Battle
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, Finn, ...you did all that for me? That's for being sweet. And that's for cheating. Finn, you know better than to ruin the sanctity of Wizard Battle. Wizards only, silly. Okay, everyone! Go home! Start getting ready for next year!@Wizard Battle
Finn@Heh heh, oh, well.@Wizard Battle
Jake@Good job. You got the kiss, man.@Wizard Battle
Finn@Thanks, man. My face hurts a little.@Wizard Battle
Jake@Don't worry about that, 'cause you look totally cool right now.@Wizard Battle
Finn@Thanks, dude. Here, you try 'em.@Wizard Battle
Jake@Okay, am I cool now?@Wizard Battle
Finn@So fly.@Wizard Battle
Ice King@How 'bout me? Put me on the grid, scale of one to ten. One is "totally gross," ten is like, "Hey, Ice King. You look crazy sick."@Wizard Battle

Prince Gumball@Wow, Fionna. You're, you're just really incredible. Maybe we should meet up, for a date.@Fionna and Cake
Fionna@No way, man. Not interested. I think the reason I got all these guy-friends and no boyfriend is because I don't really want to date any of 'em. I don't need feel like I'm waiting to be noticed. I know who I am. And I'll know what I want when and if it ever comes along. But there is one guy I would do anything to date. The Ice King!@Fionna and Cake
Prince Gumball@What?!@Fionna and Cake
Cake@Me, too. Ice King's the real deal!@Fionna and Cake
Fionna@Ice King is the hottest hottie, and I can't wait—@Fionna and Cake
Ice King@"—to marry him!" said Fionna. Then she turned to Prince Gumball and said, "I hope Ice King will sweep me off my feet and take me to the farthest corner of Ooo, where we will do nothing but kiss and eat a whole bunch until we get fat and die." The end. So, what do you think of the fanfiction I wrote about you guys?@Fionna and Cake

Tree Trunks@They took 'em. They took all of 'em.@Apple Thief
Jake@All of what?@Apple Thief

Finn & Jake@NOOOOOOOO!@Apple Thief
Finn@Don't you worry, Tree Trunks. We'll find those thieves and bring them to justice.@Apple Thief
Tree Trunks@Let me show you the crime scene. You see, boys scads of apple trees but, but no apples.@Apple Thief
Finn@Hmm. Is anything else missing, Tree Trunks?@Apple Thief
Tree Trunks@No, Finn, they didn't touch my rocks, or my birds, or my flowers, or, or nothing.@Apple Thief

Tree Trunks@Uh!@Apple Thief
Raggedy Princess@Oh, heheh, hey, Finn. Heheh.@Apple Thief
Finn@Oh, hey, Raggedy Princess. Have you seen anything fishy going on?@Apple Thief
Raggedy Princess@Um, no, heheh. I've been kinda down in this hole for a long time. I got knocked down here by some ne'er-do-wells. It was terrible. I was so scared.@Apple Thief
Tree Trunks@Ne'er-do-wells? They stole my apples. I'm gonna sass those boys up nasty!@Apple Thief
Finn@Awesome. Where do we find these guys?@Apple Thief
Jake@Oh, the Candy Tavern, man. I used to hang out there back when I used to snatch old ladies' purses.@Apple Thief

Finn@Oh, Tree Trunks, you're so silly. But, but listen, you wouldn't happen to have seen any—I don't know—apples around, have you?@Apple Thief
Bartender@"Seen any apples?" Y'all ask a lot of dumb-butt questions... almost like you're trying to solve somethin'.@Apple Thief
Finn@What? Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no.@Apple Thief
Bartender@Mmm... clean, too. Almost like some do-gooders!@Apple Thief
Jake@Hold on, we gotta go potty.@Apple Thief

Wormo@My boss is gonna be real psyched I found someone to buy his apples. A whole crate.@Apple Thief
Finn@What the?@Apple Thief
Wormo@What's wrong, guy?@Apple Thief
Finn@These aren't apples.@Apple Thief
Wormo@Oh, ya didn't mean diamonds? All ne'er-do-wells call diamonds "apples." Like calling money "bread" or rock-knockers "butter-slaps."@Apple Thief
Jaybird@Hey, Wormo, we're back—what the?! What are they doing here?@Apple Thief
Wormo@They're here for the apples.@Apple Thief
Jaybird@That's the dang Dr. J gang, Wormo! Grab 'em!@Apple Thief

Dr. J@Yeah, yeah, and I want my apples back.@Apple Thief
Jaybird & Dr. J@Get 'em, boys!@Apple Thief
Finn@Aw, don't cry, Tree Trunks.@Apple Thief
Tree Trunks@But we're never gonna find those apples.@Apple Thief
Mr. Pig@Apples? You guys looking for apples?@Apple Thief
Jake@Uh, yeah, why?@Apple Thief
Mr. Pig@'Cause I can hear a bunch of apples in this room.@Apple Thief
Jake@Wait, you mean "apples" as "diamonds"?@Apple Thief
Mr. Pig@No.@Apple Thief
Jake@"Apples" as "apples"?@Apple Thief
Mr. Pig@Yep.@Apple Thief
Finn@You mean apples that we eat?@Apple Thief
Mr. Pig@Yes.@Apple Thief
Tree Trunks@With all due respect, Mr. Pig, sir, my apples were stolen by a dirty, rotten criminal who needs to be put in jail.@Apple Thief
Mr. Pig@I'm just telling you the facts, ma'am. What I hear is a whole pigload of apples inside that closet. They sound scared.@Apple Thief
Tree Trunks@Well, I hate to tell you this, boys, but there's no apples in this closet. You see, uh, I'm the only one who knows how to open this closet.@Apple Thief
Tree Trunks@Oh, so I was the apple thief after all.@Apple Thief
Finn@No, Tree Trunks, that's preposterous.@Apple Thief
Tree Trunks@No, Finn, I'm a criminal, and I need to pay the price.@Apple Thief
Banana Guard@Banana Guard speaking.@Apple Thief
Tree Trunks@Uh, this is Tree Trunks. I've done somethin' horrible, and I want you to come over and arrest me.@Apple Thief
Finn@Tree Trunks, you don't need to do this.@Apple Thief
Tree Trunks@Thank you, Finn and Jake, but I won't let myself slip away from such a terrible crime. Goodbye.@Apple Thief
Finn@Tree Trunks.@Apple Thief
Banana Guard@Ah, this is hard to watch. I'm gonna look away.@Apple Thief
Banana Guard@This place could use a scarecrow.@Apple Thief
Finn@Huh? Wait, what'd you say?@Apple Thief
Banana Guard@Uh, I-I said this place could use a scarecrow.@Apple Thief
Finn@A scarecrow, no footprints, all those magpies on the roof, Raggedy Princess in the ditch, and all the apples in Tree Trunks's closet.@Apple Thief
Banana Guard@Boy, this place could use a scarecrow.@Apple Thief
Finn@That's it! I knew it!@Apple Thief
Finn@The magpies have been stealing the apples and accidentally dropping them in this hole!@Apple Thief
Jake@And that's why there weren't any footprints around the tree!@Apple Thief
Finn@Yes. And the magpies were able to steal the apples because Raggedy Princess wasn't sitting on the fence post to scare them off!@Apple Thief
Tree Trunks@Does this mean I'm innocent?@Apple Thief
Jake@As innocent as a baby's butt cheek!@Apple Thief
Finn@Awesome! This calls for a celebration! You know what that means, Tree Trunks!@Apple Thief
Tree Trunks@I'ma bake you the biggest and the tastiest apple pie you boys ever tasted.@Apple Thief
Banana Guards@Whoa.@Apple Thief
Tree Trunks@Uh, you boys better stick around if you want a bite of my apple pie.@Apple Thief
Banana Guard@She slapped my butt!@Apple Thief
Jake@This stinks! Hey, how much longer till we get to the mysterious party?@The Creeps

Princess Bubblegum@It looks real to me.@The Creeps
Jake@Classic move.@The Creeps
Finn@Dude. I swear I'm not pranking you. Cinnamon Bun is dead.@The Creeps
Finn@The question is who killed him?@The Creeps
Finn@One of us is possessed by a murderer. And if we want to stay alive, we have to figure out who's hiding a ghost inside their mortal body.@The Creeps
Finn@BMO!@The Creeps
BMO@Ahh!@The Creeps
Finn@Use your ghost detecting equipment to screen everyone.@The Creeps
Lumpy Space Princess@I blinked by balls. My eye balls.@The Creeps

Lumpy Space Princess@Ew.@The Creeps
Finn@Huh?@The Creeps
Princess Bubblegum@So who's the ghost, BMO?@The Creeps
BMO@Oh. Um... I don't have a ghost detecting equipment. I just like taking nice pictures.@The Creeps
Jake@Let's find some candles. If the lights go out again, we'll be able to catch the murderer!@The Creeps
Finn@Good idea! Jake and BMO, you check downstairs and we'll take this floor.@The Creeps
Jake@Okay.@The Creeps
Jake@Lay truth on me BMO, is Finn pulling some elaborate prank on me?@The Creeps
BMO@No, Jake. When bad things happen, I know you want to believe they are a joke. But sometimes, life is scary, and dark. That is why we must find the light. Aha! Found it!@The Creeps
Jake@Ooh! Thanks, BMO! BMO?@The Creeps
BMO@Help!@The Creeps
BMO@Jake help!@The Creeps

Jake@The ghost got 'im!@The Creeps
Finn@Don't you mean you got 'im- Ghost!@The Creeps
Princess Bubblegum@Guys, if there really is a ghost killer, then we should stay in a group. He can't take us all on if we're in a group!@The Creeps
Princess Bubblegum@LSP, are you okay? Where are you?@The Creeps
Jake@It sounds like she's in there!@The Creeps
Lumpy Space Princess@I'm DYING!@The Creeps
Lumpy Space Princess@Ahhh!@The Creeps
Lumpy Space Princess@Ugh, gross. My lumping body's all hollow now, I gotta put something in it.@The Creeps
Lumpy Space Princess@So where's the food? What kind of castle is this? It's like a poor people's castle! With no lumping waffles for my dump truck!@The Creeps
Jake@Chill out, girl. You find any candles upstairs?@The Creeps
Finn@No.@The Creeps
Jake@Well, I dropped a lighter downstairs, but there's no way I'm going back for that.@The Creeps
Finn@Uh-huh. Let me remind y'all that the invite says that the ghost will possess one of our bods.@The Creeps
Lumpy Space Princess@Not my bod.@The Creeps
Jake@Someone at this table isn't who they appear to be!@The Creeps
Finn@That's right, "Jake."@The Creeps
Finn@So let me ask you a question only the real Jake could answer. Who is always next to me in my recurring elevator dreams?@The Creeps
Jake@A half-orc shaman.@The Creeps
Finn@Okay, you're Jake. So, who else was absent when BMO got nabbed?@The Creeps
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh yeah, right! I'm not the ghost! I was in the potty house.@The Creeps
Finn@A convenient alibi. But tell me this...@The Creeps
Jake@Why did you break up with Brad? Only the real LSP would know that!@The Creeps
Lumpy Space Princess@Shah! As if you even know the answer to that, Jake!@The Creeps
Jake@You're right. I'm just feeling gossipy and I wanna know what happened.@The Creeps
Lumpy Space Princess@IT'S NONE OF YOUR LUMPING BUSINESS!@The Creeps
Finn@Sounds suspicious. I bet you're the ghost!@The Creeps
Princess Bubblegum@She did it! She's possessed! Tie her up!@The Creeps
Finn@Oh she is, huh? Well, before we tie up LSP, answer me this...@The Creeps
Lumpy Space Princess@Brad, he kissed me on the mouth! And I was like 'bleh-bleh-bleh', and then I was like 'Uh, gross. Go away, Brad' and he was like 'obviously you're not ready for me' but what does that even mean you guys? W-What does it lumping mean?@The Creeps
Finn@But answer me this, Princess...@The Creeps
Lumpy Space Princess@What do you want from me, Brad?! You said I was the hottest one, isn't that enough?! Why'd you have to ...my mouth!@The Creeps
Finn@What did I write to you on your Happy Birthday card two years ago? Word for word.@The Creeps
Princess Bubblegum@Finn, there's no way I would remember that...@The Creeps
Finn@I remember that.@The Creeps
Jake@You're not PB! Tie you up!@The Creeps
Princess Bubblegum@What! Wait you guys! Look!@The Creeps
Finn@A real ghost?!@The Creeps
Lumpy Space Princess@Aah! Don't touch me! Don't touch ME!@The Creeps
Finn, Jake and Lumpy Space Princess@DAAAAAG!@The Creeps
Finn@This wasn't supposed to... ha-a-appen!@The Creeps
Jake@Aha! I knew you were pranking me back, you!@The Creeps
Finn@Yeah... it was all a set up. The doors, Cinnamon Bun's and BMO's. Oh strizz! BMO and Cinnamon Bun should be in the closet over there. Guys! Guys, guys! C'mon you guuuu-.@The Creeps
Lumpy Space Princess@OH MY GLOB! I can't take this, you guys. I'm calling my lumping parents right now!@The Creeps
Finn@LSP! What's happening!@The Creeps
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh my Glob! I'm not ready! Get away! Oh, gross!@The Creeps
Finn@Where'd did she GO?!@The Creeps
Jake@Look! I'm scared, bro.@The Creeps
Jake@RUN, HOMIE, RUN!@The Creeps
Finn@Open it!@The Creeps
Jake@It won't open!@The Creeps
Finn@C'mon!@The Creeps
Jake@Okay...@The Creeps
Finn@Jake!@The Creeps
Jake@Ow, ow, ow! I got a splinter!@The Creeps
Finn@Jakey!@The Creeps
Jake@Don't let go, man!@The Creeps
Finn@Oh no! Your fancy GLOVES!@The Creeps
Finn@Jake... Princess!@The Creeps
Finn@YEEAAARGH!@The Creeps
Jake@Haha! Gotcha, dude! Two for two!@The Creeps
Finn@WHAT!?@The Creeps
Jake@I figured out your plan months ago! So I flipped the script. Oh yeah!@The Creeps
Finn@So everyone's okay. BMO, Cinnamon Bun...@The Creeps
Jake@Yeah, see?!@The Creeps
Finn@Whoa, sick! You can phase people into your body?!@The Creeps
Lady Rainicorn@당연하지! 난 제이크랑 항상 한 몸이 되는데. ("Of course. Jake and I merge our bodies all the time.")@The Creeps
Lumpy Space Princess@I'm ready for you now, Brad. Isn't it so obvi? I'm so ready.@The Creeps
Finn@But, PB. You melted!@The Creeps
Princess Bubblegum@It was a wax dummy, dummy! Jake switched me out while Lady was distracting you.@The Creeps
Finn@Wow, you got me again! I can't believe that! With the hair, and the house coming alive and stuff...@The Creeps
Jake@The what?@The Creeps
Finn@The walls and chairs trying to eat me and stuff.@The Creeps
Jake@Eh, nah. You must have been so scared you imagined that part.@The Creeps
Finn@Uh, no I didn't...@The Creeps
Jake@Haha, nice try, Finn. Let's get outta here.@The Creeps
Finn@That one's going in the vault. Aaaaand... It's gone.@The Creeps
Finn@Hurry, Lady!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@It's happening again.@From Bad to Worse
Princess Bubblegum@That's right, Finn.@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Princess!@From Bad to Worse
Princess Bubblegum@The zombie infection has spread across the kingdom once again, ...and once again, it's all my fault.@From Bad to Worse
Princess Bubblegum@I was testing a sample of the zombie flesh I had saved when Cinnamon Bun came into the lab. He said he was hungry.@From Bad to Worse
Cinnamon Bun@I'm hungry.@From Bad to Worse
Princess Bubblegum@Not now, Cinnamon Bun. I'm busy.@From Bad to Worse
Princess Bubblegum@And that's when I made my mistake. I should have paid more attention to that poor fool. The Candy Zombie flesh he ingested was highly contagious.@From Bad to Worse
Princess Bubblegum@Cinnamon Bun? Where did you... EEEEHHHHH!!!@From Bad to Worse
Zombie Cinnamon Bun@Sugar!@From Bad to Worse
Princess Bubblegum@I escaped, but I wasn't able to stop Cinnamon Bun from infecting the rest of the kingdom. The good news is I still have all my notes for making the antidote formula.@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Oh, sweet!@From Bad to Worse
Princess Bubblegum@Let's board up the windows then we can get started.@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Princess!!@From Bad to Worse
Princess Bubblegum@Don't worry, Finn. You have the notes to my formula. Just let Science do the work. Science... is... MAHHRRAHHH!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Nooo!!!@From Bad to Worse
Lumpy Space Princess@Get that zombie outta here!@From Bad to Worse
Lumpy Space Princess@Aw, nah! I am not getting eaten by zombies tonight. Get the lump outta here!!! Ahh! Ahh!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Princess!@From Bad to Worse
Jake@These notes make no sense. It's all gobbledy-gak.@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Alright, we'll each make our own version of the formula. One of us is bound to get it right.@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Hmm?@From Bad to Worse
Jake@Hey, Princess Bubblegum trained her rat to dance. Neat.@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Done.@From Bad to Worse
Lumpy Space Princess@Done!@From Bad to Worse
Jake & Lady@Done!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Bubblegum, I'm comin' for you!!!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Mine first.@From Bad to Worse
Winged Zombies@Sugar!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Cram!@From Bad to Worse
Starchie@Oh, my, that's a lot of zombies down there. Starchie's glad he's up here. Dang it!@From Bad to Worse
Jake@Let's get out of here!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Stairs!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Jake, try yours and Lady's next!@From Bad to Worse
Lumpy Space Princess@Move outta the way! My formula is going to cure the zombies because I made the prettiest formula.@From Bad to Worse
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh. My. Glob. Look at those luscious lips. I gotta go lick up the rest of that formula! Aaaaaaah! My formula! Formula! Oh, my Glob. Yes, I'm gonna be hot! So freakin' hot! Yeah!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@LSP, look out!@From Bad to Worse
Lumpy Space Princess@Huh. I know you want this body, but you can't have it! You can't have it!@From Bad to Worse
Finn & Jake@LSP!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Dang it, Jake. We only got one formula left. Try yours and Lady's.@From Bad to Worse
Jake@Right.@From Bad to Worse
Jake@Let's hope this works.@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Wh-... where now?!@From Bad to Worse
Jake@We can barricade ourselves in the lab!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Did anyone get bit?@From Bad to Worse
Jake@I think we're good. That door is made out of candy steel.@From Bad to Worse
Jake@What's the matter?@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Jake! Did it get 'cha?@From Bad to Worse
Jake@I think I'm okay. It's just a little bite.@From Bad to Worse
Lady@Jake!@From Bad to Worse
Jake@It's all good, Sweetie. I can stretch forever. Hehehehe... Hey, let's hurry up with that antidote, huh, pal? Whooa...@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Okay, let's see here...@From Bad to Worse
Jake@You should try one of them books. Over there by the lab rat.@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Ha! Yeah, okay. Yes! This book has a glossary of symbols.@From Bad to Worse
Jake@That's great, buddy.@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Jake, I think this little guy has serious dance fever.@From Bad to Worse
Jake@Don't come near me, Sweetie! Oh, man, I'm outta shape. I think I should just stay in here, ya know. Just in case. Ya oh.@From Bad to Worse
Jake@Hurry, dude!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@I am! Okay, Jake's probably going turn into a zombie, which is okay. I just have to figure out this formula.@From Bad to Worse
Lady@Jake? Jake?@From Bad to Worse
Lady@Jake!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Hang on, Lady! I'll have the antidote soon, but whatever you do, just don't let him out. He may look like the Jake that once loved you, but he's just a zombie!@From Bad to Worse
Lady@아니야. 얘는 날 사랑해. ("No. He loves me.") @From Bad to Worse
Finn@Hey, Lady...@From Bad to Worse
Finn@The book!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Sorry, everybody. Sorry, LSP, PB, Jake, LR, peepee poopoo doodoo. You know, it's funny; I don't even know your name.@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Yeah? What is it, girl? "Sci... ence." Your name is "Science"? Could it be?@From Bad to Worse
PB@Just let Science do the work. Science... is... MAHHRRAHHH!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Hmm...@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Here goes nothing.@From Bad to Worse
Jake@Finn!@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Jake!@From Bad to Worse
Jake@You did it! I huh, uh...@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Don't worry, Science. I've got a disgusting idea. OH, MY GLOB!!!@From Bad to Worse
Jake@Sorry about biting you, sugar.@From Bad to Worse
Lady@난 네가 깨물어 주는 게 좋아. ("I like it when you bite me.")@From Bad to Worse
Jake@Oh.@From Bad to Worse
Princess Bubblegum@And so the Royal Day of Apologizing has come to an end. And now I shall present the Royal Medal for Heroic Bravery. Finn the Human.@From Bad to Worse
Finn@Yes.@From Bad to Worse

Jake@Well, I'm no princess, sister!@Jake vs. Me-Mow
Me-Mow@Yes, I know, but since you've blown my cover, you will slay Wildberry Princess.@Jake vs. Me-Mow
Jake@What!? I'd rather be injected with poison!@Jake vs. Me-Mow
Me-Mow@Oh. Uh... okay.@Jake vs. Me-Mow

Finn@Fast-forward, BMO.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Finn@Play, BMO.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Ice King@So there we are. Turtle Princess is frozen and in my little ice wheelbarrow, and there was... magic in the air. We were both feeling it. But before I could leave the library, Finn and Jake show up. You know how Jake is. Stretch this, stretch that, bah! He knocks off my crown and then Finn bonks me on the nose. Still hurts, too. The worst part is Turtle Princess took away my library card! You know, dear diary, I'm starting to worry that all these entries sound exactly the same, and that my life is just me running in place on some... giant hamster wheel.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Jake@Fast-forward, BMO.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Jake@I'm gonna take a nap...@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Finn@No! These tapes are important! We just don't know why yet. BMO, fast-forward to triple speed!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
BMO@Okay.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1

Ice King@Come on, baby... in the pocket... I can't do it...@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Jake@Maybe he's talkin' in secret code.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Finn@Telling evil secrets in secret code... He's brilliant!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Jake@Well, how do we decode the secrets?@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
BMO@Why don't we call others for help?@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Finn@BMO, you're brilliant!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Jake@Well, who do we call?@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Finn@Um... The smartest person we know, Princess Bubblegum! She's brilliant...@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Finn@Hey, Princess Bubblegum.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Princess Bubblegum@Hey, Finn.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Finn@Jake and I found a bunch of secret tapes! We were wondering if you'd help us decode them.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1

Jake@Yeah, they're really stupid, but, y'know... Maybe they're encoded or whateva.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, you called the right person. I know a lot about codes. Let's start with—@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Finn@What?@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1

Finn@Hey, Princess. We got disconnected.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Ice King@Hello, Finny.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Finn & Jake@Hey/Uhhh, you sound weird!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Ice King@Must be a bad connection. That's why we were disconnected earlier on the telephone.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
BMO@Ice King is on the phone outside!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1
Finn@So... how's the weather in Candy Kingdom?@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 1

Jake@Yeah, it's kinda chilly in here.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Agh... What's on those tapes...? I can kinda... make it out... Dang it, BMO, just turn to your right a little.... Ugh!! By the power of ice... I want your cup of cocoa to fall over. Yes! Now turn and pick it up... Yes... Yes... That's... me? THEY'RE WATCHING MY SECRET TAPES?! And they're cozy. I'll show them. This snowman looks pretty good. Pretty darn good!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Penguin@Wenk.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Could I have five more minutes, please?@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
BMO@I think I can break the code, Finn.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Finn@Really?@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
BMO@Yes. I have detected a noticeable pattern in the tears of sadness that fall from the Ice King's eyeballs. His tears drop at an equal rate until the thirteenth tear, when the right eye drops two tears instead of one.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Finn@Whoa...@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Jake@This is so fascinating...@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
BMO@The thirteenth letter of the alphabet is "M." If I print the letter "M" every time the Ice King says an "M" word, it looks like this! @Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Finn@Oh, my Glob, Jake... Is this it? Could this be the Ice King's evil secret? WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Some of you won't survive this. You'll melt or split in half or your head will fall off... but that's fine... because you're made of snow. Only one thing matters today! Getting into that tree house, getting my tapes back, and beating up Finn and Jake! Maybe BMO. Yeah, BMO too! Who's with me?! Hey, why're you guys so quiet? Are you mad? Oh, that's right. You're not alive yet. My bad.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Gimme my tapes back.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Finn@No, man! I know you've got evil secrets on these, and we're gonna find 'em!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Snowmen! Attack!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Finn@Crip, Jake! We gotta unravel these evil secrets at warp-crazy!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Good morning. You're watching the evening news. There's been an unfortunate event. Let's go talk to some witnesses. Princess, what is your name?@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Wildberry Princess@Please! Let me go home!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@So, Princess "Please-let-me-go-home," what was it like to experience this tragedy?@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Wildberry Princess@What? I... I don't... uh... um...@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Yeah, we're on air, honey, so spit it out.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Wildberry Princess@I... I don't know what you're talking about.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Obviously traumatized and in a state of shock. Let's go ask somebody else something. Upside-down Princess, do you think things will change politically because of today's events?@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Wildberry Princess@You're really frightening me.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Well, there ya have it, folks. People are very upset that Gunther tried to eat Ice King's socks! Very upset! That's why Gunther has to stay in the corner!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Finn@Weird... He's sneakin' in through the chimney!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Ah... The element of surprise... Ah, jeez, I'm filthy. Well, now I'm cleaner, but I'm also nakeder. Ohh! Mmm... Just what I need... Hehehehe... Come on, come on!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Jake@Yeeeesh.....@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@They wouldn't be in the fruit bowl! Ohhh! Well, look at you with your nose shining so bright! You're so unique! Hehe! I'll name you Red-nose, and make you leader of the pack! Eh... Well, now you look boring. You want somethin' done right, ya gotta do it yourself.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Now gimme my evil tapes back!! They're supposed to be buried!! In the ground!! Snow goons!!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
BMO@Oh, no!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Jake@Don't worry, BMO!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
BMO@Finn! There is one more tape!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Finn@Play it! His evil secret must be on that tape!!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@No, BMO, please don't play it.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Simon@Hello. My name is Simon Petrikov. I am recording this tape so that people will know my story.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Oh, no! Turn it off, BMO, turn it off!!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Simon@I was studying to be an antiquarian of ancient artifacts. Now, I never believed in the supernatural stuff myself—just had a fascination with superstitions... but everything changed when I came into contact with this item....@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Finn and Jake@The Ice King!!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Simon@After purchasing this crown from an old dock worker in northern Scandinavia, I brought it home and excitedly showed my fiancée Betty, and jokingly put it on my head just for a laugh or something... and that's when it started... The visions... I fought with them... Shouted at them until I realized it wasn't real—it was the crown!! I quickly took it off... and saw my fiancée in front of me... looking at me with such contempt. What had I said? What had I done when I wore this crown? All I know is I never saw Betty again.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Simon@Since then, I see the visions always whether or not I wear the crown. They tell me the secrets... the secrets of the ice and snow... that the power of the crown will save me with its frost. I don't yet know what this means. As you can see, my skin is beginning to turn blue. My body temperature has been lowering at a supernatural rate, to what is now about 30°C. I don't know when it will end... I'm really scared...@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Simon@I know my mind is changing... but I'm already too far gone to know what to do. I want people to know that... if I do things... if I do things that hurt anyone, please... please forgive me.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Simon@Just watch over me until I can find a way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity!! And then maybe Betty, my princess... maybe you will love me again. Please love me again, Betty!!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Jake@Drrr-AMA bomb!!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Now you know my secret! You know... that I used to wear glasses! Maybe kidnapping Wildberry Princess will cheer me up.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Finn@Wait, Ice King. BMO, eject tape, please. Here, Ice King.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@What's this? You're giving me... a gift.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Finn@No... It's... well... These belong to you.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@But it's not even my birthday! This is so exciting! Video tapes! Heh, you know, I had a bunch of these once, but I threw them away! This is great, Finn! Thank you!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Jake@It's from me, too.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Oh! I have presents for you guys, too! Here. It's a small pine tree. I chopped it down in one foul swoop! And this is for you!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Jake@Uh... thanks.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Oh, isn't this fun?! We're giving each other presents, we're wearing silly clothes, there's snow everywhere... Let's do this every day!@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Jake@Uh...@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Finn@How about once a year?@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Ice King@Okay, that sounds good.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Shelby@And so it was decided... that once every year when the weather got chilly, that Finn, Jake, the Ice King, BMO, Princess Bubblegum, Marceline the Vampire Queen, Cinnamon Bun, Peppermint Butler, Phil, a candy cane man, one of the gumdrop girls, Lady Rainicorn, Lumpy Space Princess, that guy, the other guy, a pig, Tree Trunks, a two-headed duck, the old crazy Tart Toter, the punch bowl, a booger, and Gunter... would get together while wearing really big sweaters and watch videos on the floor next to a fire... to celebrate the day when Finn and Jake had a fleeting moment of empathy for the biggest weirdo in Ooo. It was a miracle. Good night.@Holly Jolly Secrets: Part 2
Finn@Do you think it's right for Marceline to invite us to jam without Princess and BMO?@Marceline's Closet
Jake@It's just a jam sesh. Is that what you're gonna jam with?@Marceline's Closet
Finn@Yeah, man. Balloon music is the future. Listen.@Marceline's Closet
Jake@Pretty good. I don't think you mastered it yet.@Marceline's Closet
Finn@Well, duh. I just started.@Marceline's Closet
Jake@Oh, dude. There's a note.@Marceline's Closet
Finn@What's it say?@Marceline's Closet
Jake@"Hey, guys, I had to run out, but I'll be back," blee-bloo-blop, "Don't go in my house."@Marceline's Closet
Finn@That's it?@Marceline's Closet
Jake@Yeah. Just "Don't go in my house" in all caps... written in blood.@Marceline's Closet
Finn@Hmm. What are you doing?@Marceline's Closet
Jake@Eliminating desire from my heart. It helps pass the time.@Marceline's Closet
Finn@Come on! I can't do that! Let's play Cloud Hunt 'til she gets here.@Marceline's Closet
Jake@No, man, I got a mental block with Cloud Hunt!@Marceline's Closet
Finn@Yeah, that's what makes it awesome, 'cause I know I'll win.@Marceline's Closet
Jake@Oh, what?! Bring it on, brother! Now explain the rules 'cause I forget.@Marceline's Closet
Finn@Okay. I count to ten and you go hide somewhere. Then, I gotta try to find you. You can hide... anywhere in here. Anywhere in here, ...but Marcy's house is off limits because she said so. Okay?@Marceline's Closet
Jake@Got it.@Marceline's Closet
Finn@Okay. I'm gonna start counting. Ready?@Marceline's Closet
Jake@Yes.@Marceline's Closet
Finn@Go! One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Four...@Marceline's Closet
Finn@Cloud Hunt... GOTCHA! Huh. Hmm. AH-HA! JAKE! Get out of there! Marceline's gonna kill you! Jake! I know this isn't a mirror. What the—?! You're doing it wrong, even! Get out! Get out!! Dude, get out of there! She's gonna kill us! She'll be home any minute! Did you read the note?! I mean, you read the note! You told it to me!!@Marceline's Closet
Marceline@Smells like sourdough in here.@Marceline's Closet
Jake@She's gonna kill us. Once she finds out she's gonna tie us up and eat us like a spider.@Marceline's Closet
Finn@You don't think I know that?! Hmmmmmmm... We'll wait for the right moment and sneak out... right under her big, fat caboose.@Marceline's Closet
Jake@Okay, man. I can do this. Egh! Egh! Egh!!@Marceline's Closet
Finn@Shh, here she comes!@Marceline's Closet
Jake@Here she comes...@Marceline's Closet
Finn@Shh, shh!!@Marceline's Closet

Finn@Get down. Love, FINN + JAKE"] When she gets this, she'll leave and we can escape!@Marceline's Closet
Jake@Brilliant... but how's it gonna work?@Marceline's Closet
Finn@I'll fly the paper as an airplane down the bedroom ladder. It'll triple barrel roll past the kitchen, open the fridge, and cook some eggs, then eat the eggs, and unfold itself as it lays in the carpet in front of Marceline's door!@Marceline's Closet
Jake@Yeah, yeah, awesome, yeah!!@Marceline's Closet
Jake@No, nah, nuts!@Marceline's Closet
Marceline@Welp... they're not gonna show up, then I'll just work on my own stuff, I guess. Take one for new concept album based on five hundred years of my journal entries. So here's some preliminary notes. I... I wanna make this the most emotional album ever. So private and secret, that I'll never let anyone hear.@Marceline's Closet
Jake@This is so wrong.@Marceline's Closet
Marceline@No one can ever hear it. Ever. Take one.@Marceline's Closet
Jake@We've crossed the line! I'm gettin' outta here, man!@Marceline's Closet
Finn@Yeah! Do it!@Marceline's Closet

Jake@Why are you talking?!@Marceline's Closet
Finn@I'm wondering if she's awake.@Marceline's Closet
Jake@Well, if she's awake, she can definitely hear you talking!@Marceline's Closet

Jake@Well, now we're both quietly screaming.@Marceline's Closet
Marceline@I can hear both of you.@Marceline's Closet

Jake@Well, yeah!@Marceline's Closet
Marceline@HEY! Exssssplain yourselves.@Marceline's Closet

Jake@Hmm? Hey, man, did—@Marceline's Closet
Finn@AAAAAAH!!@Marceline's Closet
Jake@AAAAAAH!!@Marceline's Closet
Finn@It's slippin', dude.@Paper Pete
Finn@Phew. Raini-corni-copia? An Unabridged History of the Rainicorns. Whatever, man. I barely even made it through the title.@Paper Pete
Jake@Listen, man. One day, I'm probably gonna have half-rainbow pupsters. I gotta be able to share my babies' culture.@Paper Pete
Finn@Huh. Oh. Hey, this table is wobbly. We gotta take it to the Lost Tinker Goblin of Fog Mountain to fix it.@Paper Pete
Jake@Dude, I would love to go on some crazy, made-up adventure with you, but I really gotta read this. So from here on out, I'm just gonna ignore you.@Paper Pete
Finn@I don't make up adventures! Jake, you know that! Jake! I don't make up adventures! Hm. Books, books. Kitties, Zitties, Witties, Mitties, Knitties, Fitties, Hitties, Jitties, Pities, Cities... Oh, no! Damaged books? Who did this?!@Paper Pete
Turtle Princess@Shhhhhhhushh!@Paper Pete
Finn@Sorry. I will avenge thee, slightly-soiled books. Gotta tell Jake.@Paper Pete
Finn@Hello? Is someone back here? Are you stuck?@Paper Pete
Turtle Princess@Shhhushmm!@Paper Pete
Finn@Hello? Whoa! Ohhh! Hey, there's pages comin' outta these books!@Paper Pete
People offscreen@SHHHHHH!@Paper Pete
Finn@Who are you dudes?@Paper Pete
Pagelings@We are the Pagelings!@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@I am Paper Pete, the leader of the Pagelings. But you can call me P.P.@Paper Pete
Finn@I'll call you Pete.@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@Okay!@Paper Pete
Finn@Why are you dudes in the library?@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@We are the secret guardians of the books in the library. You know those blank pieces of paper in the beginning of old books?@Paper Pete
Finn@Yeah?@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@That's us! We revealed ourselves to you, noble giant, because you felt our plight when you saw the damaged books. And now is our darkest hour, for the Moldos have been growing more bold with every attack. Look at the damage done yesterday at the Battle of Teddy Bear Joke Book.@Paper Pete
Finn@Wow, yeah.@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@They're massing for a full-scale assault on every book in the library!@Paper Pete
Finn@Gosh! Even the Rainicornicopia?@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@Yes.@Paper Pete
Finn@I better tell Jake. Don't you dudes go anywhere.@Paper Pete
Pagelings@Okay.@Paper Pete
Finn@Hey, bro, I've got an adventure—and it's not made up! There are these- these Pagelings they came out from- from books! And they- they folded into little animals.@Paper Pete
Finn@Do you hear what I'm saying?!@Paper Pete
Jake@Shhhh!@Paper Pete
Finn@You think I'm making this up?@Paper Pete
Finn@I'll prove it to you!@Paper Pete
Jake@Finn! Finn, you butt chicken!@Paper Pete
Finn@Jake, wait till you see 'em.@Paper Pete
Finn@Ow.@Paper Pete
Finn@They were just here! Pagelings?@Paper Pete
Finn@Why didn't you dudes introduce yourselves to Jake?@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@We don't want to reveal ourselves to anyone else. We are the secret guardians. Secret.@Paper Pete
Finn@Ummmm... yeah, but Jake is a powerful giant like me! He can help you battle or- or whatevs! But first, you must win his favor. Do you not want victory for your people?@Paper Pete
Pagelings@Yes! We do want victory!@Paper Pete
Finn@C'mon, follow me. Jake, look.@Paper Pete
Finn@He's up here reading a book.@Paper Pete
Finn@Do something to get his attention.@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@Very well. We shall dance as flowers.@Paper Pete
Other Pagelings@Hoo-ah!@Paper Pete
Finn@Okay.@Paper Pete
Finn@Jake, the Pagelings are dancing for you. Just look up for a second!@Paper Pete
Jake@Finn, all the little voices you're doing are cute, but come on, man! Just let me read.@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@By wearing the beast, we shall become like the beast.@Paper Pete
Finn@You can feel them, can't you?@Paper Pete
Jake@I can feel you pinching me.@Paper Pete
Finn@Just look up for a second! Looooook. Uhhh. Pagelings, I'm sorry, but my friend is acting like a clump.@Paper Pete
Pagelings@Okay.@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@We can't wait any longer. We must go back to the bookshelf to prepare for the Moldos' attack@Paper Pete
Jake@Yeah, go play make-believe somewhere else!@Paper Pete
Finn@I'm not making believe!@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@We were gone too long!@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@Wield, my brethren. Wield!@Paper Pete
Moldo@You win this battle, but next time, we will win.@Paper Pete
Pagelings@Yes, leave! Victory! Veni, vidi, vici!@Paper Pete
Finn@So, those little squishy guys are the Moldos?@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@Aye. This was but a reconnaissance squad... sent to test our mettle!@Paper Pete
Pagelings@Mettle!@Paper Pete
Finn@Uh-huh. They seem tough.@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@Their bites sting like the Dickens.@Paper Pete
Finn@Hmmm... their bites sting, eh? I've got a plan, Pete.@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@Tell me your plan, giant.@Paper Pete
Finn@Just trust me. Trust me.@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@You've discovered the Moldos' Secret Lair!@Paper Pete
Finn@Eh, it wasn't very hard.@Paper Pete
Finn@Wibba-wibba-wah!@Paper Pete
Moldo@The Pagelings have a battle beast! Attack!@Paper Pete
Finn@Whoa. Whoa, moldy blobs. I've come here to help the Moldos defeat the Pagelings.@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@Traitor! Hiyah! Yah!@Paper Pete
Finn@Calm down, this is part of my plan.@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@Ohhh, ha-ha! Then I shall play along, wise giant.@Paper Pete
Moldo@How are we to trust you?@Paper Pete
Finn@Well... here, look. I brought you all a prisoner. It's their leader.@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@May you rot in Tartarus! May your skin boil and eyes burst into flames... forever in a pit!@Paper Pete

Finn@Oh, uhh... hmm. Nice to meet you, your highness.@Paper Pete
Mildwin@I'm not a king; I was democratically elected.@Paper Pete
Finn@That's adorable. Now, Finn!@Paper Pete
Moldo@Protect the elected official!@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@Well played, ol' giant. You have the cunning of Odysseus.@Paper Pete
Finn@Pete, j-just stop winking. Hyah!@Paper Pete

Finn@Ummm...@Paper Pete
Jake@AH! AAAH!@Paper Pete
Finn@Uhhh... come on, you guys, knock it off.@Paper Pete
Finn@The Moldos got a taste for ya now.@Paper Pete
Finn@Gotta do something. Where can I find ways to solve problems in a library? "Books"? Books! Books! Books!@Paper Pete
Jake@Aaah!@Paper Pete
Finn@Huh? Whatcha nibblin' me for?@Paper Pete
Moldo@This sweaty stuff tastes amazing. A-mazing!@Paper Pete
Finn@Hmmm. Tastier than battle beast fur. Yis!@Paper Pete
Finn@Hey, Mildwin. Mildwin!@Paper Pete
Mildwin@What?@Paper Pete
Finn@I bring a peace offering from the Pagelings.@Paper Pete
Mildwin@Hmm?@Paper Pete
Jake@Finn... what's happening?@Paper Pete
Finn@Hang on, buddy. Paper Pete?@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@Giant! Have you wiped out the Moldo horde?@Paper Pete
Finn@Naw, man. The war's over. Mildwin, you can keep my shirt if you don't attack their library books.@Paper Pete
Mildwin@Agreed, beast. This filthy garb will feed my people for generations.@Paper Pete
Finn@And in forty years, you can have my shorts. Sound good, Pete?@Paper Pete
Paper Pete@It will suffice.@Paper Pete
Finn@Sound good, Jake?@Paper Pete
Jake@AAAH! What—What the hecks, man?! What'd you do to me?!@Paper Pete
Finn@Look, man! Moldos and Pagelings are real!@Paper Pete
Jake@Wha—? Who cares, man?! I'm outta here!@Paper Pete
Finn@Did you finish your Rainicorn book?@Paper Pete
Jake@Ugh... I was readin' the same paragraph over and over for, like, eleven minutes. I guess I'm gonna give up on learnin' everything about Rainicorn history. Don't tell Lady.@Paper Pete
Finn@Oh. What about relating to your mixed-species kids?@Paper Pete
Jake@Eh, I'll just fake it.@Paper Pete
Finn@Oh. Well... hey, man, I think I see some, um... Sun People in trouble on the sun over there.@Paper Pete
Jake@You makin' that up?@Paper Pete
Finn@Mmhmm.@Paper Pete
Jake@Yeah! Let's do it!@Paper Pete
Finn@WHOO! WHOOOO!@Paper Pete
Head Clown Nurse@Who wants a cookie? Milk-dipped chocolate chip cookie?@Another Way
Finn@No thanks.@Another Way
Head Clown Nurse@Now, come on, Finn. You have to eat. Open Sesame...@Another Way
Finn@Uh, Jake, can't we get rid of these Clown Nurses? They make me feel ridiculous.@Another Way
Jake@No way, man.@Another Way
Jake@Well, now you know we can't jump off of birds. I paid them up front. They don't leave until the job's done. Besides... They're funny. Look, she just farted.@Another Way
Head Clown Nurse@Time for our love therapy.@Another Way
Finn@Wait, what are they doing? Whoa! Stop!@Another Way
Head Clown Nurse@Oh my! Did that hurt, dear?@Another Way
Finn@NO!! I just don't want you kissing my toe!@Another Way
Head Clown Nurse@Now, now, honey, you gotta understand. This is the only way to "foo-foo" your boo-boo.@Another Way
Finn@What does that even mean??@Another Way
Jake@I don't know... but I'm feeling better already. Ah. That tickles.@Another Way
Big Clown Nurse@You want me to stop?@Another Way
Jake@No, keep going.@Another Way
Finn@You're gross, man. Look! Deep in the forest of trees, there's a Cyclops whose magical tears can heal any wound. See? See?@Another Way
Head Clown Nurse@Maybe you should leave the medical decisions to the medical professionals, and my professional prescription is... your toe needs crazy smooches! It's the only way!@Another Way
Finn@Huh? Wha?@Another Way
Finn@Wait! Wait! Wait! There's another way! There's my way! Let me show you my way!@Another Way
Finn@Ahh! Let me go!@Another Way
Head Clown Nurse@It's the only way!@Another Way
Head Clown Nurse@It's the only way!@Another Way
Finn@MY WAY!!@Another Way
Finn@Hmmm...@Another Way
Tree Stump@Ring, ring! Look, there's only two choices, bro. Take your pick. There's the path on the left, Hair Fall-Out Path. No more hair again, ever! Or the path on the right, Smelly Path. Makes you smelly forever. Hoohoo, you won't believe it.@Another Way
Finn@Isn't there another way?@Another Way
Tree Stump@Nope.@Another Way
Finn@But what if I just went—@Another Way
Tree Stump@No, that's it! You have to choose! There's no other way! Choosing is the only way. Choosing—is the only—way.@Another Way
Head Clown Nurse@It's the only way!@Another Way
Tree Stump@Hey, listen man, the Smelly Path's not actually that bad!@Another Way
Finn@NO! I choose MY WAY!! My way.@Another Way
Bush@Ring ring. Hello, dummy police? Yes, there's a strange dummy lurking around my house. Okay, yes. Thank you. Goodbye.@Another Way
Finn@Wha...? I need to cross the river. The Cyclops is over there.@Another Way
Bush@You can't cross this river. It's impossible! Look! The current is so fast, it'll turn your butt inside-out for real, doofus. And the water's so acidic it'll crump your boat in half. It's like orange juice. It's gross. There's a bridge, but it's a trap! Plus, the water's jamming with electric eels. Wow, so weird. Anyway, that's it, there's no other way around, you dummy.@Another Way
Finn@But I need to get across.@Another Way
Bush@Listen what I'm telling you. There's no way. ...Ugly tramp.@Another Way
Finn@Glob, Glob it, Glob it, Glob it...@Another Way
Bush@Huh? What are you saying? "Globbit, Globbit"? Who's Globbit?@Another Way
Finn@MY WAY!!@Another Way
Bush@Glibby glob, man! You're crazy! We're not even half way across! You gotta go back, man! It's the only way, you ugly fat-smelling fat-head!@Another Way
Finn@NO, MY WAY!!@Another Way
Finn@MY WAY! Oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob.@Another Way
Pan@Uhh, excuse me, friend. You're pretty tall, can you reach up there and get my wheel for me? Gotta get these melons home to my wife. You know how it is.@Another Way
Finn@MY WAY!@Another Way
Pan@Watch out, Rainy!@Another Way
Pan@Rainy!@Another Way
Finn@Whoops. Uh... man, I'm real sorry.@Another Way
Pan@Yeah? No doy... friend.@Another Way
Finn@But... I can still help. I'll fix your house for you.@Another Way
Pan@Just get out of here! Leave us alone!@Another Way
Finn@Uh... wh... I...@Another Way
Pan@Psycho fink.@Another Way
Finn@♫ I was wrong. Was I wrong? No. Yes... Yes... I was wrong. How could it be? I trusted in my guts, but ended up all nuts. I was wrong. How could it be? Listened to my brain, but ended up insane. The melons rolled...over that lady. I went too far. How could it be? How did I go... too far? ♫@Another Way

Finn@Naw, man, I peeped beyond her burning gaze, and noshed hot lunch with her soul. She ain't evil. She's passionate. Help me track her down.@Hot to the Touch
Jake@Hmmm..@Hot to the Touch
Finn@C'mon, man, I really like her. Help me out. Jake, Jake help me out. Help me out. Jake, Jake, help me. Jake, Jake, help me!@Hot to the Touch
Jake@Eeeeeeeeehhh, ok.@Hot to the Touch
Finn@Whoo! Alright!@Hot to the Touch
Jake@You sure you're not into any other princesses? What about Wildberry Princess? She's small and plump. You could sleep on her like a pillow. Could be nice.@Hot to the Touch
Finn@Is that bird... smoking?@Hot to the Touch
Brown Bird@Hey, don't you judge me. It was that fire chick down there that done this to me.@Hot to the Touch
Flame Princess@Oh.@Hot to the Touch
Finn@Oh, Jake... look at her. She's innocent. Like the steam off a puppy's nose, searching for ham in the snow.@Hot to the Touch
Jake@Guy drops one piece of ham in the snow and he never hears the end of it! Snap out of it! She's burning cute little flowers!@Hot to the Touch
Finn@Yeah, she is like a cute little flower.@Hot to the Touch
Flame Princess@Aaahh!@Hot to the Touch
Finn@Oh, no, are you ok?@Hot to the Touch
Finn@I... I was just worried about you.@Hot to the Touch
Flame Princess@Huh?@Hot to the Touch
Finn@Look, I'm sorry about what I said before. I don't know what happened, but I just, I had to see you again. And, I don't know.. I don't know anything about you, but I just, I really like you. You know, you're so... beautiful.@Hot to the Touch
Finn@Whoa!@Hot to the Touch
Flame Princess@Ah!@Hot to the Touch

Finn and Jake@Aah!@Hot to the Touch
Finn@Hey, I like your fireballs.@Hot to the Touch
Flame Princess@Huh? Why do you torment me?@Hot to the Touch
Finn@I'm not trying to. I just like you. I think I... I think I like-like you. Listen, when I look at you, my brain goes all stupid. And I just wanna hug you, and sit on the couch and play BMO with you. I can't explain why, but, I never felt this way before and I think we should be together.@Hot to the Touch
Flame Princess@I...@Hot to the Touch
Finn@Yeah.@Hot to the Touch
Flame Princess@Rggh! Enough. You should not toy with the emotions of a fire elemental.@Hot to the Touch
Finn@Wait wait, I really didn't--@Hot to the Touch
Flame Princess@You told me you liked me, and you made my flame grow brighter, but then you put me out, with your heart!@Hot to the Touch
Flame Princess@You're trying to impede me. That must be your purpose, ...but fire's purpose is to burn, so I'm going to turn this land into my fire kingdom!@Hot to the Touch
Finn@No!@Hot to the Touch
Jake@She's headed for Goblin Kingdom! We need to defeat this fiery she-beast!@Hot to the Touch
Finn@I can't fight her, man. I'm still into her!@Hot to the Touch
Jake@Finn, what's more important? Your love for that screwball dame, or being a hero and savin' the lives of innocent goblin folks?@Hot to the Touch
Finn@Rrrrhh.. Being a hero.@Hot to the Touch
Jake@Alright, c'mon! Let's go build fire-proof suits.@Hot to the Touch
Finn@Uh-uh-uh, I gotta' get back to her.@Hot to the Touch
Jake@Dude, slow down or your fire suit will be junk. Ooh. Is bags of old bread fire-proof?@Hot to the Touch
Neptr@Jake, you've found Neptr! I am the ultimate hide-and-seek champion! 15 months, 4 days, 9 hours and you guys did not find me! Hahahaha-hahaha.@Hot to the Touch

Finn@Neptr, will you help us build fire-proof suits?@Hot to the Touch
Neptr@You cannot tell but I am giving a thumbs up.@Hot to the Touch
Neptr@I am finished!@Hot to the Touch

Finn@Wha?@Hot to the Touch
Neptr@Locked on target.@Hot to the Touch

Neptr@Not true, creator. You haven't failed Neptr. Even if everyone burns, you'll still have me, creator.@Hot to the Touch
Jake@Mmm!@Hot to the Touch

Flame Princess@Ow! Huh?@Hot to the Touch

Finn@N-No. I-I don't usually do that.@Hot to the Touch
Flame Princess@That's your power.@Hot to the Touch
Finn@No! N-N-N-NO-NO-NO!@Hot to the Touch
Flame Princess@Finn, even if we like each other, we're going to hurt each other.@Hot to the Touch
Finn@No, we don't have to. I can take it... I... I mean, can't we try?@Hot to the Touch
Flame Princess@You would defy nature for me?@Hot to the Touch

Jake@No. I guess not.@In Your Footsteps
Finn@Okay. Great. I'm going back to bed. You comin', smart guy?@In Your Footsteps
Jake@Yeah, okay.@In Your Footsteps
Jake@You're not even a little weirded out by this?@In Your Footsteps
Finn & Bear@No, man. He's just doin' his instincts. He's like a parrot or chameleon or something. He's funny!@In Your Footsteps
Finn@Anyway, I gotta go pick up BMO from soccer. I'll be back soon. And remember don't eat my special Finn cakes. Finn only.@In Your Footsteps

Jake@Hey, what are you doin'?! Why, you little...! Tryin' to set me up, eh? You think you're so smart, but this time, I'm ready.@In Your Footsteps
Finn@OH, MY GLOB, WHAT?!?! JAKE! YOU ATE ALL MY FINN CAKES! WHAT THE STINK!@In Your Footsteps
Jake@Uh, nope. The bear did it, and I've got proof. I taped the whole thing.@In Your Footsteps
Finn@The bear ate all my cakes, and you just sat there and watched him do it?! What's wrong with you?!@In Your Footsteps
Jake@Ju— What?! No, man, he was tryin' to frame me, Finn! He's tryin' to steal your identity! Why can't you grok that?!@In Your Footsteps

Finn@She's not my... We never went steady.@In Your Footsteps
Jake@He's trying to replace you, and he's already got everyone convinced he's you! He didn't really like you. He used you.@In Your Footsteps
Bear@Tops blooby! Tops blooby. Tops—@In Your Footsteps
Finn@Not cool, man. You're not me. You're just a bear acting like me. It's okay, everyone. The imposter is gone.@In Your Footsteps
Princess Bubblegum@Finn... nobody really thought the bear was you.@In Your Footsteps
Finn@Wait... what?@In Your Footsteps
Princess Bubblegum@We just thought it was one of your jokey-joke-jokes.@In Your Footsteps
Finn@Hey! Hey, bear!@In Your Footsteps
Jake@Wait up, guy!@In Your Footsteps
Finn@Hey. I... I didn't mean to make you feel so bad about yourself. I'm really sorry about that.@In Your Footsteps
Jake@Me, too.@In Your Footsteps
Finn@But... you're a super-rad bear, so... why not just be you?@In Your Footsteps
Bear@I... want... be... hero... like... yooouuuu!@In Your Footsteps
Finn@Awww...@In Your Footsteps
Jake@I guess he's got a heart of gold after all.@In Your Footsteps
Finn@Hold on, bear. I got something for ya. It's the Enchiridion, the hero's handbook. Everything you need to know about being a hero is in this book. Take it, and learn.@In Your Footsteps
Jake@Finn, are you nuts?! We can't give that book away! It's, like, crazy-important!@In Your Footsteps
Finn@Whatever, man. We never use it, except for, like, sitting on it when the grass is wet and stuff. Drink your fill of knowledge. Someday, you'll be a great hero.@In Your Footsteps
Bear@Thank you, Finn. Thank... yooouuu...@In Your Footsteps
Voice@Did you bring the book?@In Your Footsteps
Snail@Yessss... One step closer.@In Your Footsteps
Finn@The Tree of Blight.@Hug Wolf
Finn@Every hundred years, it spews evil spores across the land.@Hug Wolf
Jake@Then let's burn its butt down to the root rubbin's. Finn, I can feel a bunch of eyeballs peepin' us from the woods.@Hug Wolf
Alpha Hug Wolf@Huuugs!@Hug Wolf
Finn@What the—?! Is this an extra butt?! Quick, Jake! Burn the tree!@Hug Wolf
Alpha Hug Wolf@Huuuugs! Gonna hug you up, boy! I'm gonna snuggle you to pieces!@Hug Wolf
Jake@Dude! The tree's about to 'splode its evil juice all over!@Hug Wolf
Finn@No! Jake, hurry!@Hug Wolf
Jake@Is he crushin' you, man?!@Hug Wolf
Finn@No, he's just... hugging me gently!@Hug Wolf
Jake@Oh...! When you see the wicker devil in tree afterlife, tell 'im Jake says, "Hello."@Hug Wolf
Jake@Hey, buddy, you okay?@Hug Wolf
Finn@Didn't even tell me its name...@Hug Wolf
Jake@Wha..,?@Hug Wolf
Finn@Oh, sweet! Ha-ha-ha!@Hug Wolf
Finn and Jake@Hot to the touch!@Hug Wolf
Jake@Hmmmm... Dude, why're you so huggy?@Hug Wolf
Finn@I just feel affectionate, I guess. Hugging helps.@Hug Wolf
Jake@Hmm... You've got a fever, man.@Hug Wolf
Finn@I feel hot.@Hug Wolf
BMO@Finn, you're hurting me.@Hug Wolf
Jake@I think you need a good night's sleep.@Hug Wolf
Jake@You feelin' better today?@Hug Wolf
Finn@Yeah. I feel like a million clams.@Hug Wolf
Jake@Good. Hey, you think we have enough candy litter? Litter for lunch! Mmm!@Hug Wolf
Cinnamon Bun@Huh? Not again!@Hug Wolf
Finn@What's the matter, Cinnamon Bun?@Hug Wolf
Cinnamon Bun@Please, Finn. If you're gonna hug me again, don't make it as hard as you hugged me last night.@Hug Wolf
Finn@Uh... I didn't hug you last night.@Hug Wolf
Cinnamon Bun@Yes, you did! My love handles still hurt! You came into my room around midnight and gave me a squeeze—a really strong one!@Hug Wolf
Finn@CB says I hugged 'im. Haha. Cinnamon Bun, you got some crazy notions. I tell ya. Oh, Cinnamon Bun. What a crazy story, buddy.@Hug Wolf
Jake@Yeah, buddy, but you were pretty huggy last night... buddy.@Hug Wolf
Finn@Wait. You don't think I actually snuck into Cinnamon Bun's room and hugged him, do you?@Hug Wolf
Jake@I'm just sayin' you were really clingy.@Hug Wolf
Finn@But no. Why would I? And don't tell me it's because I have repressed emotional feelings for Cinnamon Bun.@Hug Wolf
Jake@No. I have a theory, ...but I don't like it.@Hug Wolf
Jake@Your questionable behavior started about an hour or so after you got hugged by that wolf man, right?@Hug Wolf
Finn@...So...?@Hug Wolf
Jake@Well, I've been thinkin' that maybe that wolf man wasn't what he seemed. Maybe he was some sort of hug wolf. Yeah, here it is. "Hug wolves—a subset of wolf men which roam the countryside with a fervid hug lust. Every night, hug wolves must go out and hug people to satisfy their insatiable craving for hugs. To become a hug wolf, one must be hugged by an alpha hug wolf on the night of a full moon."!@Hug Wolf
Finn@Like last night!@Hug Wolf
Jake@Yes. So you must be a beta hug wolf. A lower-level creature.@Hug Wolf
Finn@Well, how can I get uncursed?@Hug Wolf
Jake@Lemme, um... read the book a little more. Says there's no known cure.@Hug Wolf
Finn@Uh... I'm scared, Jake...@Hug Wolf
Jake@No hugs!!@Hug Wolf
Finn@I'm sorry! I feel hot! Rrrrr!!@Hug Wolf
Jake@What's wrong, BMO?@Hug Wolf
BMO@I am terrified of Finn.@Hug Wolf
Jake@Hmm. Well, that plant's not gonna protect you. You can get this under control, buddy. ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??@Hug Wolf
Finn@I think so.@Hug Wolf
Jake@I said... ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??@Hug Wolf
Finn@Yeah. I heard you. I said I think so.@Hug Wolf
Jake@I'm tryin'a' getcha to shout.@Hug Wolf
Finn@Oh. Okay. IS THIS GOOD?!?@Hug Wolf
Jake@Never mind. Now. I want you to think about hugging a cactus. How would that feel?@Hug Wolf
Finn@Prickly and painful.@Hug Wolf
Jake@Good, good, you're doin' great!@Hug Wolf
Finn@Cool. So, can I hug the cactus now?@Hug Wolf
Jake@No, you can't hug anything.@Hug Wolf
Finn@But that poor cactus! It... it... NEEDS ME!@Hug Wolf
Jake@Oh, no, the hug lust is already takin' over your brain!@Hug Wolf
Finn@I want to hug you, Jake! Close!@Hug Wolf
Jake@Finn... say something to reassure me.@Hug Wolf
Finn@I'LL HUG YOUR MOM!@Hug Wolf

Finn@Huh? Huh? What... What happened? Jake... what happened to me last night?@Hug Wolf
Jake@You hugged... everyone.@Hug Wolf
Finn@NO!@Hug Wolf
Upside-Down Ice Cream Cone@We're mad, but we're not gonna go down there.@Hug Wolf
Finn@People of the Candy Kingdom, all I've ever wanted was to keep you all safe, ...and because I can't undo the hugs I've caused, my sole wish is to be locked up forever in the Candy Dungeon.@Hug Wolf
Candy Baby@Why's Finn in the cage, Mama? Isn't hugs nice?@Hug Wolf

Ice King@Uh oh... I mean, that's good! Oops! How fun! You're so fun!@Princess Monster Wife
Princess Monster Wife@Hahahahaha!@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@Aww... marriage is fun!@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@See, when you wash and I dry, we get done faster! Then tomorrow night we switch!@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@Here, let me show you a trick, my darling. See, you let it soak and we'll wash it in the morning.@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@Enough chores... come along, dear. I want to show you something special...@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@Here it is. I hope you like it...@Princess Monster Wife
Princess Monster Wife@Is there something wrong with me? The way I am...it's not normal... is it?@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@Oh... pretty baby wife. You're the most normal thing in my whole life. We're like two normal jelly beans sitting at the bottom of the jar, floating in a sea of olives, waiting for somebody to guess how many jelly beans are in the jar... which I mentioned.@Princess Monster Wife
Princess Monster Wife@I don't think I understand...@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@Just look into my eyes and know that everything is okay.@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@Are you feeling normal yet? Okay. See that? We're normal, just like the normal people are.@Princess Monster Wife

Ice King@What's going on in here? Nobody's a monster! All I see in this room is a young, kind-hearted, intelligent, hot-looking ice king, and his beautiful princess bride! That's you, sweetie...@Princess Monster Wife
Princess Monster Wife@I don't feel beautiful. I feel like a freak!@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@I will prove to you that you are beautiful!@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@To me, my penguins! Gunter, Gunther, Gunder, Goonder, come on! Gunter, Goonthy, Gonter, Ginthy, follow!@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@Don't rearrange the chairs please. You're all gonna clap and cheer or I'm gonna smack your buns. Whoo! Yeah! ...@Princess Monster Wife
Finn@If we look at her with these mirrors, her ugliness will have no effect on us.@Princess Monster Wife
Jake@Where is she? Oh! I think she's right over...@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@Hey!@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@Baby, do you want to talk about it?@Princess Monster Wife
Princess Monster Wife@You should just find another princess to marry. I'm unlovable!@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@Girl, I love you as much as all of the other princesses in the world combined!@Princess Monster Wife
Princess Monster Wife@You don't really mean that...@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@I'll prove it! See, you have Elbow Princess's hips, and Dr. Princess's heart and intestines, Slime Princess's bottom... You have all my favorite parts of my favorite princesses!@Princess Monster Wife

Ice King@Sure, baby, even without all your fine lady parts. Now give us a hug.@Princess Monster Wife
Finn@Hey, Ice King!@Princess Monster Wife
Jake@Your wife's face can't make us faint anymore!@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@Don't listen to them babe; they're being negative! Run, my happiness! I'll distract them with ice magic!@Princess Monster Wife
Jake@Ouch.@Princess Monster Wife
Finn@Do you give up?!@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@Yes! I give up...@Princess Monster Wife
Jake@Finally... let's get those princess parts back to the ladies.@Princess Monster Wife
Finn@Yeah, mans. Wait... where'd your wife go?@Princess Monster Wife
Finn@Huh?@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@Let me go! Let me go!@Princess Monster Wife
Princess Monster Wife's spirit@Though my parts be scattered, I will always be your wife.@Princess Monster Wife
Ice King@She... she... gave away all my stuff!@Princess Monster Wife
Jake@What'ya building?@Goliad
Finn@Um, it's just a little stick fort.@Goliad
Jake@Oh, rad!@Goliad
Jake@Look. It's just my size.@Goliad
Jake@Hey, get away from my fort, you big stinky monster!@Goliad
Finn@I like it when you get small, Jake.@Goliad
Jake@Yeah, me too.@Goliad
Jake@Whoa, whoa!@Goliad
Finn@Whoa, Peppermint Butler!@Goliad
Peppermint Butler@Finn, Jake, the Princess wants to see you.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@As princess of Candy Kingdom, I'm in charge of a lot of candy people. They rely on me. I can't imagine what might happen to them if I was gone. And after my brush with death at the hands of the Lich, I realized something. I'm not gonna live forever Finn. I would if I could.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@But modern science just isn't there yet.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@So I engineered a replacement who can live forever.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@I call her... Goliad.@Goliad
Finn & Jake@Wow! Aww! She's cute.@Goliad
Finn@Hi, Goliad. I'm Finn.@Goliad
Jake@And I'm Jake.@Goliad
Goliad@Hi, Finn. Hi, Jake.@Goliad
Finn@Hi, Goliad.@Goliad
Goliad@Hi, Finn.@Goliad
Finn@What did you use to make her?@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, um... Pretty standard candy creature soup.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Some acids.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Some algebra.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@And I threw in one of my baby teeth so she had my DNA.@Goliad
Finn & Jake@Wow, DNA?!@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Yeah. All it takes is just one little tooth, or, a single hair.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@It's all it takes.@Goliad
Jake@Princess Bubblegum, are you okay?@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good. Haven't slept for a solid 83 hours, but... yeah, I'm good.@Goliad
Jake@Aw, you should go to bed.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@I can't go to bed, Goliad has huge, mondo mama brains.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@I still need to fill them with knowledge... about how to rule a kingdom.@Goliad
Finn@What? Let us teach her.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Uhh, okay. I guess that will be all right.@Goliad
Finn & Jake@Yea! Yeah! Teachers! Yeah, woo-hoo! Teach, teaching teachers.@Goliad

Goliad@Yeah, thanks Finn. I'm excited to learn.@Goliad
Finn@Okay, great. Jake, you go and get some kids from inside to help with the lesson and such.@Goliad
Jake@Okay. C'mon, Goliad.@Goliad
Goliad@Yes, Jake.@Goliad
Jake@Uhm...@Goliad
Jake@Uhh...@Goliad
Red Gumball/Candy Child@Stinking, durken...@Goliad
Candy Nanny@Now, now, settle down.@Goliad
Goliad@Jake, these kids seem pretty scary.@Goliad
Jake@Ah, nah, these kids ain't nothin'! Kids groove doozyploon! Check this out.@Goliad
Jake@Hey, there kids, who wants to play--@Goliad
Jake@Uhh, easy now children. Easy-@Goliad
Peanut Child@Get his brain! Get his brain!@Goliad
Peanut Child@Get his eyes!@Goliad
Jake@Listen up, you kids better stop donkin' around! You're gonna mess up Goliad! It's my way or the highway, get it? I'm Don Juan Cherry Tempo! Now march, glib blobbit!@Goliad
Jake@Don't be acting all crazy.@Goliad
Jake@Wow, holy shmow!@Goliad
Finn@Oh, hey, y'all are just in time. You ready to pop this croc's back Dr. Goliad?@Goliad
Goliad@Yeah, I think so Finn. I've learned a real lot already so far. Sooo much... from Jake.@Goliad
Jake@Uh, you know, Finn... maybe this isn't such a good idea, actually.@Goliad
Finn@Oh, no, it's cool. I got helmets for everybody.@Goliad
Finn@Okay, Goliad, you ready to lead?@Goliad
Goliad@Ready!@Goliad
Finn@Okay, in 3, 2, 1... Go!@Goliad
Goliad@Alright, listen up! You kids better stop dunking around and get on that ramp!@Goliad
Goliad@You're gonna mess up Goliad! I'm Don Juan Cherry Temp— Cherry Tempo! It's my way or the highway, Glob-globbit!@Goliad
Finn@Stop stop! No, Goliad, no! Leading isn't about scaring people, you gotta stay calm and use your head. Use that beautiful brain, girlfriend.@Goliad
Goliad@My brain? Are you sure?@Goliad
Finn@Yeah! Don't be shy. Try it on me, lead me.@Goliad
Goliad@Okay, Finn. Okay.@Goliad
Finn@No, Goliad, that's wrong, too.@Goliad
Finn@You can't just control people or whatever, it's messed up.@Goliad
Goliad@No, Finn. This way is good. Everyone did what I wanted. Really fast, no mistakes, calm like you said. This is definitely is the way to lead. Definitely.@Goliad
Finn@Um, no, no. ...Wait, is that true?@Goliad
Jake@C'mon, Goliad. Let's go see Princess Bubblegum.@Goliad
Finn@Princess! Princess!@Goliad
Jake@Goliad's got mind control powers!@Goliad
Finn@She got the wrong idea about leadership!@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, I was afraid this might happen. Where is she now?@Goliad
Finn & Jake@She's chilling in the garden! We left her outside the garden!@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Hello, Goliad.@Goliad
Goliad@Hello, Princess.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@I hear that you learned a lot today.@Goliad
Goliad@Yes, I led the children.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@But Finn said you used yelling and mind control.@Goliad
Goliad@Yes, it was good.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Goliad, let me tell you about leadership. You see this fat bee? It's gentle and makes the flower happy, and pollinated. They both get what they need... ...and that's how leaders should be.@Goliad
Goliad@No, Princess. Bee cares not for flower. If getting pollen hurts or kills flower, bee would not care. Bee is stronger than flower.@Goliad
Goliad@Goliad is stronger than bee. Goliad is stronger than all.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, no. She's too far gone, too corrupted. If we're not careful, she can throw an ultra-tantrum and wind the castle apart. I will have to disassemble her and try again.@Goliad
Goliad@No, Princess. This is my castle now.@Goliad
Finn@Don't worry, Princess. We'll stop her!@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@No, Finn. She's far too powerful. Here's the plan I'm going to build another Candy Sphinx in my lab. It's the only thing that can possibly match her. Just keep her busy 'til I return. And don't think about the plan! She can read your minds!@Goliad
Jake@Ugh, eyeball... Just tuck that eyeball back in its hole.@Goliad
Finn@Goliad, no!@Goliad
Finn@Jake, don't swallow!@Goliad
Finn@Uhh, you're in Finn's bubble.@Goliad
Finn@Don't think of the plan... Think of something else. Think of something else.@Goliad
Finn@Don't worry, Princess. We'll stop her!@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@No, Finn, she's too—@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Anyway, like I was saying, she's far too powerful—@Goliad
Princess Bubblegums@Finn, she's far too powerful. Here's the plan.@Goliad
Baby Finns@I'm a buff baby that can dance like a man. I can shake-ah my fanny, I can shake-ah my—Ahh!@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Here's the plan. I'm going to—@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Goliad! No!@Goliad
Goliad@Wait, brother, why must we fight? Rule with me!@Goliad
Goliad@No, brother! Don't you see? They're turning us against--@Goliad
Goliad@So be it.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Finn, are you okay?@Goliad
Finn@Yeah, that dude saved me.@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@That's Stormo, Goliad's new brother.@Goliad
Finn@Wha-- What are they doing now?@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@They're about to have a psychic showdown.@Goliad
Jake@Wow, man, so, like... I guess they're so evenly matched that it's a stale— It's a stale—@Goliad
Finn@They're so evenly matched that it's a stalemate!@Goliad
Princes Bubblegum@Yes. Stormo sacrificed himself to keep Goliad in check for all eternity.@Goliad
Finn@Well, that's pretty cool, but... I don't understand. If Goliad and Stormo are the same, how come Stormo is a good guy?@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, that's simple I used some of your heroic DNA in Stormo's recipe and not Goliad's.@Goliad
Finn@Oh, whoa so, that means Stormo is like... my son?@Goliad
Princess Bubblegum@Well, yeah... in a way.@Goliad
Finn@Happy birthday, Stormo.@Goliad
Jake@Man... let's go home.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Nuts to that. I wanna find a mystery cave.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@But, Finn, I'm gettin' all cranky around my joke-hole.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Ow!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@Oof!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Ooh-la-la.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@Whuzzat?@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Mystery cave! C'mon, Jake! Oh, my glory...@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@Dude, no!! Don't touch that thing! It's probably got some kind of sacred significance.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Yeah. I want it for my sacred bathroom.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@Finn?! Oh, my Jah! Finn's become one with the lamb!!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Jake!! You see this crazy jazz?!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@We'll get through this, my bro. I swear, I'm gonna get you out of that lamb.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Jake! C'mon quit messin' with me. WHOA!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@Ow. Ow. Ow.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@Wish I knew how to free you, bro.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Me, too, bro.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@BMO, stop fake-farting.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
BMO@But Finn always loved BMO farting.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Heh heh heh heh heh!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@Hmm... That's it! We'll do all Finn's favorite stuff 'til he comes out! BMO! Play Finn's favorite song!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
BMO@Okay!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@What? Nooo... No! Not this song!!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@Are you hearing this, buddy?@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Guys... I haven't liked this song since I was two. Cut it OUT!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Leaf Princess! Come to me, my arboreal beauty! Gotcha!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@It's just a dumb old leaf, ya dumb old Ice King.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@I know, but it's mine.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Wait! What?! Ice King! You can hear me?@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Yes... Why? Are you makin' fun of me or something?@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@No, it's just no one else can see me or hear me talk.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Ohhhh, yeah.... You're trapped in the Spirit Realm. I can see all things Spirit with my... Wizard Eyes!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Man... Never thought I'd be happy to talk to you, Ice King. Can ya help me get free??@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Oh, yeah, I know all the ins and outs. And I'd do anything for a friend like you.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Penguin@Wenk.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Quiet, Gunter. Can'tya see I'm hanging with Finn?@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Penguin@Wenk wenk.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@I know I say that a lot, but this time it's true!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Anyways... Where do all these spirits come from?@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Oh, there are portals all over the universe. I have one in my basement! Every once in a while, a real cutie pie drifts through. Ooh! Oh, gosh, there she is. Mm, oh, yeah...@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Sick.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@What? I swear I never touch 'em! I can't! Can't touch this, can't touch this... Can't touch this, either. Yep, I can't kill any of them. I hate them... Okay, alright! 'Nuff messin' around. Let's getcha free from the Spirit Plane.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Cool.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Sooo, the only way to get out of the Spirit World is to stick all these lousy things in the Spirit Hole down there. Then plug up the hole with that.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@And doing that will set me back to normal??@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Mm-hmmmm, trust me! We are tur-bros! Turbo bros! Tur-bros. Turbo. ...Bros.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@So be it!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@Alright, Finn. This oughta free you from your body prison. Couple-a' rounds of Kompy's Kastle will jog your psychic schnaps. That's what I think. Co-op mode like we always do! Oh, yeah! C'mon, Finn, drop the drawbridge. Kompy's blood lust meter's goin' down. Lemme help ya there. Whuzza!! You love Kompy!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@I... did it. I did it. I'm ready, Ice King. Make me normal now.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Ohhh, that's not all of 'em. There's this other guy that watches me. He's... super creepy. Do ya see it?? Oh, it see's you... Catch it and put it in the Spirit Hole! In the Spirit Hole where it can't see me anymore so you can be free!! Get it! Get it!! GET IT IN THE HOLE!!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Ew! Ew! Ew! Eeeewwww!!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Yes! It's gone!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@So... now I can go back to normal.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Uhhh, wait, though.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@...What?@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@There's this last guy you gotta get. He's pretty much the worst. He usually leaves these gross heads around, but I'm not seeing them anywhe— OH! THERE IT IS! THERE IT IS!!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Head@Wanwan. Wanwan. Wanwan.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Nooo...@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Head@Wanwan! Wanwan!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@NO! DON'T COME NEAR ME!!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Head@Wanwan!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@What is that?@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@It's from the dead one. He leaves these heads around everywhere. I can't even touch them, but it still creeps me out...@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Head@Wanwan!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Please get rid of him!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@What do I do? Follow the heads?@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@USE THE HEADS!! Oh, snow, please!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Alright, man, I'll get it. Where's your daddy, huh? Is he hiding in there?@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Head@Wanwan.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@You better get back in the Spirit Hole, dead one. Okay...@Beyond this Earthly Realm
The Dead One@Wamwanwan.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Oh, my what? The cave?? How the...??? ...Weird. That's weird, but whatevs, though. Whatevs. Ice King! Ice Kiiiing! Where'd you go, Simon? Ice King? Dude, come on, what?@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Ha ha, Finn! You fell right into for my brilliant plan that I formed out of the thin air like a true Magi! Not only did I get you to remove those horrible creatures from my castle, but now you're trapped, and only I can see you. So if you want friends, this is it, pal!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@I'm gonna re-open the hole.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@NO, WAIT, MY PLAN FELL APART!! My... new plan is that you don't open the hole, and I destroy the porcelain lamb which will bring you back to the material plane. Heh heh... heh.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Jake. AGH, BLUH! GIMME THAT LAMB!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@NO!! Finn's trapped in here!!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@That's why I have to smash it!!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@You donk! I will smash you!! WAAAH!!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Escaped! AAAH! My winter body!! I was gonna start up on the elliptical again, but I got depressed, okay?! Don't look at me!!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@Whoooo?!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@AAH! They're touching me for real! EWW!!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Great. Now we're both stuck in here.@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@FINN, GIVE ME YOUR CLOTHES!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@STOP! WUUH!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@I need a buffer!! AAAH!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Ah, jeez, come on!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@I'm sorry... I'm sorry, they were just touching me on the body... I'm sorry...@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Whoa, do that again. Your hand is affecting the TV! We must have some kinda subtle effect on the material plane!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Cooool. Whaddaya think, Finn? Can we pull back the veil of static and reach into the source of all being? Behind this curtain of patterns... this random pattern generator... So clever... right here in every home, watching us from a one-sided mirror... Heh heh heh, whoops! Just wizard-talkin' to myself!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@It's okay! But let's use our subtle influence to break the lamb!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Yeah, a'ight. You mean like this?@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@Yeah, man! Bwoooo! It's workin', man! Combine the swirls!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Ice King@Okay! Wha-zah!!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Jake@Whoa! Finn, is that you?!@Beyond this Earthly Realm
Finn@YES!!@Beyond this Earthly Realm

Lumpy Space Princess@Finn! You've probably been wondering where I've been for the last few hours!@Gotcha!

Lumpy Space Princess@But you're the one who's hot, Finn!!@Gotcha!
Finn@Wow. Uh, thanks!@Gotcha!

Lumpy Space Princess@Gotcha...@Gotcha!
Jake@Why does he want your crown anyway, Princess?@Princess Cookie
Finn@Yeah, what's his beef?@Princess Cookie
Princess Bubblegum@I don't know, guys—he's crazy. He's left me no choice. I'm sending in the banana guards. It's about to turn crazy nasty. Hello. Captain Banana Guard?@Princess Cookie
Jake@Wait a second, Princess. Why don't me and Finn just sneak in there incognito and neutralize the threat, old-fashioned spy guy-style?@Princess Cookie
Princess Bubblegum@Hmm. Okay, but if you guys aren't out of there by 400, I'm sending in the guards.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Okay, I was thinkin' I could dress up like a mailman.@Princess Cookie
Finn@Yeah. Yeah, and I could wear all black and I could be like, you know, like, your shadow.@Princess Cookie
Princess Bubblegum@Hmm. I can't really see that working.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Yeah, the shadow thing might be pushin' it.@Princess Cookie
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, no-no-no, that part's fine. I was talking about you dressing up like a mailman.@Princess Cookie
Jake@What? But I always wanted to be a mailman.@Princess Cookie
Princess Bubblegum@Nah, you don't look like a mailman. You look like a milkman. Let's get you a proper milkman outfit.@Princess Cookie
Jake@You ready?@Princess Cookie
Finn@Yeah. Let's bust it.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Hello.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@"Hello"?! Who the heck are you? I'm gonna smash your face.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Uhh, milkman, sir. I brought the milk—for the hostages, sir.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Huh? Oh. I thought maybe you were a spy guy or somethin'. Go ahead, give everyone some milk, then get the math outta here.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Yes, sir. Milk, sir?@Princess Cookie
Marshmallow@Thanks.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Milk?@Princess Cookie
Candy Person #103@Thanks.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Milk?@Princess Cookie
Marc@Thank you.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Some milk?@Princess Cookie
Finn@Psst! Get ready, Jake. When we get to the cookie, you throw some milk in his face and yell, "Alvin's hot juice box. Alvin's hot juice box." He'll be really confused, and that's when we grab him and tie him up-style.@Princess Cookie
Chipper@Come in, Cookie. This is Chipper. Over.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Go ahead, Chipper. Over.@Princess Cookie
Chipper@I'm too short to lock the back door. Over.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Hold tight, Chipper. Chipler's on his way. You got that, Chipler?@Princess Cookie
Chipler@Affirmative.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Did you hear that?@Princess Cookie
Finn@Yeah. Change of plans—I'll go take care of those chips. You keep the cookie distracted.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Yeah. I can do that.@Princess Cookie
Finn@Okay, awesome.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Milk? Milk? Milk? Some milk?@Princess Cookie
Cookie@What? Oh. Look, you should probably split, buddy. Things are about to get pretty flipped out in here.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Oh, sure. Sorry, man. I was just trying to get away from that rotten Princess Bubblegum for a while, y'know? Isn't she just the worst?@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Wait, you hate Princess Bubblegum, too? Get outta here!@Princess Cookie
Jake@Oh, yeah, man, she's the worst. Sittin' out there all safe and cozy while I'm riskin' my life tootin' around in here in this stupid milkman costume.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Wait—costume?!@Princess Cookie
Jake@Oh, um... I just mean it feels like a costume... 'cause I wanted to be a mailman so bad, ya see? But the princess—she made me be a milkman anyway.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Boy, I hear ya, brother.@Princess Cookie
Chipolina@Cookie, you there? Over.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Yeah. Go ahead, Chipolina. Over.@Princess Cookie
Chipolina@I just saw a light go on in the stock room—probably nothing. I'll check it out. Over.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Okay. Over.@Princess Cookie
Chipolina@Hmm. Looks like a false alarm, Cookie. It's just some kid's Baby Snuggleghost nightlight. Hee-yah!@Princess Cookie
Finn@Alvin's hot juice box! Alvin's hot juice—@Princess Cookie
Jake@So what's your story, man? How'd she doodie on you?@Princess Cookie
Cookie@I was just a kid, man, just a little kid, when I got doodied on.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@I was the new guy at the Candy Orphanage. They called me Baby Snaps. I tried to make friends with the other kids...@Princess Cookie
Baby Snaps@C'mon, guys, let's dance it up!@Princess Cookie
Cookie@They were always too depressed to play.@Princess Cookie
Candy Child@No, no. We're too depressed.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Things went on like that for a while, then... one day... she showed up. Everything was different.@Princess Cookie
Princess Bubblegum@...a thunderous cheer as Baby Whoozlefut...@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Everything was-was better with her around. And something inside me changed that day, too. And then later she told me I could be anything I wanted.@Princess Cookie
Princess Bubblegum@Anything your sweet heart desires!@Princess Cookie
Cookie@And I told her I wanted to be a princess like her, so I could make all the children happy.@Princess Cookie
Baby Snaps@I wanna be a princess like you!@Princess Cookie
Cookie@And she laughed in my face, man! It really messed me up.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Holy shmow, man. That's terrible. That's really terrible. Listen, I—@Princess Cookie
Cookie@She LIED to me!@Princess Cookie
Jake@Yeah, but, maybe she didn't realize how much it meant to you.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@No, she just wants to hog all the princessin' for herself! All chips, report in. It's time to get real! Over. Chips. Chips. Over. Chips! Where are my chips?! Chipolina! Chipler! Chipton! Chipper! Is anyone there?! Chipface? Something happened to my chips! AAAAH! I'm about to flip out, man... and take that crown!@Princess Cookie
Jake@Whoa, whoa, wait! It doesn't have to be like this! You don't need that crown. You could start over, man. You can start a new kingdom—your own kingdom... where everyone can be whatever they wanna be. I can be the mailman... and you? You can be the princess. And—@Princess Cookie
Cookie@My own kingdom?@Princess Cookie
Jake@Yeah, man.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@I... I'd like that.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Okay, then. Just sit tight, Princess. I'll get us outta here. Hey! Hey! I'm comin' out!@Princess Cookie
Princess Bubblegum@What?@Princess Cookie
Princess Bubblegum@Jake? Jake, what's going on? Where's Finn? Where are the hostages?@Princess Cookie
Jake@Don't worry, Princess. It's okay now. Princess Cookie's gonna go away. You just gotta give him a horse to escape with and he'll go.@Princess Cookie
Princess Bubblegum@Right... and then you and Finn hunt him down and put him in the dungeon.@Princess Cookie
Jake@No, wait. He said he'd go away forever. Can't we just let him go?@Princess Cookie
Princess Bubblegum@No. That cookie is a menace. Once the hostages are safe, Cookie goes in my dungeon—in my dungeon for his life.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Oh, boy! Would ya look at that?@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Dang!@Princess Cookie
Princess Bubblegum@Okay, well... she's all yours!@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Hot diggity!@Princess Cookie
Jake@Ah-ah-ah! Man, that horse ain't no good; that's a trap horse.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@What are we gonna do?@Princess Cookie
Jake@It's okay, man, I'm Jake. J-J-J-Jingo Jango!@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Whoa! Ha HA! You're magic!@Princess Cookie
Princess Bubblegum@After them!@Princess Cookie
Cookie@We're really doing it!@Princess Cookie
Finn@Jake! What are you doing?! What happened to the plan?@Princess Cookie
Jake@New plan—I'm gonna help Princess Cookie escape.@Princess Cookie
Finn@What? But-but he's a criminal!@Princess Cookie
Jake@No, man, Princess Cookie's a good guy. He just got dealt a bad hand. He's only trying to be what following how his dreams make you want to be, man!@Princess Cookie
Finn@Whaaaat?@Princess Cookie
Jake@You're either with us or against us.@Princess Cookie
Finn@Um... 'gainst? WAAAH! Oof.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Hold on tight, Cookie! I'm gonna jump the gorge!@Princess Cookie
Cookie@No, Jake. Stop the horse.@Princess Cookie
Jake@I can make it!@Princess Cookie
Jake@Princess Cookie! Are you all right?@Princess Cookie
Cookie@I'm done for, Jake.@Princess Cookie
Jake@No, everything's gonna be fine. I won't let them put you in the dungeon. Just let me talk to them.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@No, Jake.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Thank you for your help, but it's too late for me.@Princess Cookie
Cookie@I'll never be a princess. At least for a moment, you helped me feel like a princess. It was wonderful. Thank you, Jake.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Careful, Princess!@Princess Cookie
Cookie@You know what? It's funny, but you sort of remind me of a mailman I used to know.@Princess Cookie
Jake@I do?@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Yep.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Princess!@Princess Cookie
Cookie@I glubbed up!@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Knight to E-5.@Princess Cookie
Jake@Where's Baby Snaps?@Princess Cookie
Jake@Excuse, me! Your highness!@Princess Cookie
Cookie@Jake!@Princess Cookie
Jake@Oh, hey. Check it out! Special delivery from the Grass Kingdom!@Princess Cookie
Various Patients@He's a princess? I had no idea. Royalty!@Princess Cookie
Finn@Hey, Jake, what's wrong? You look dumpy. How come? Is it because of that metal box? Is something sad inside?@Card Wars
Jake@No. It's nothin'.@Card Wars
Finn@There's lots of boxes that have nothing in them, but also, you can put something in the box, and then it won't be empty. Does that make you feel better?@Card Wars
Jake@Ha ha. You're a charmer, Finn Human. No... it's... well... Lady Rainicorn doesn't wanna play the game Card Wars with me. I always beat 'er... so she says, "No more Card Warring."@Card Wars
Finn@What's Card Wars?@Card Wars
Jake@It's a fantasy card game that's super complicated and awesome, but—well... No, it's kinda stupid. Never mind.@Card Wars
Finn@How come you never talked about it before? It sounds cool!@Card Wars
Jake@Really? Well... I thought you'd say it was for nerds who do not know how life is outside of the nerd universe.@Card Wars
Finn@It is, man. But I still totally wanna play it. So no more moping, okay?@Card Wars
Jake@Thanks, Finn.@Card Wars
Jake@Oh, hey, BMO. You wanna play, too?@Card Wars
BMO@No. I do not play such games... with Jake.@Card Wars
Finn@What's that mean?@Card Wars
Jake@Ah, whatever. Let's play the game.@Card Wars
Finn@So what kinda stakes do we play for?@Card Wars
Jake@How about... the loser... is a dweeb, and the winner is a cool guy?@Card Wars
Finn@Those are good stakes.@Card Wars
Jake@Coffee ground, beetle butter, grape jelly, kimchi, and... this stuff. @Card Wars
Finn@Hey! You're ruining that pop with weird taste!@Card Wars
Jake@We drink when the game is over.@Card Wars
Finn@Oh, gross.@Card Wars
Jake@Now lemme explain the rules.@Card Wars
Jake@That's basically the basics! So once we have our kingdom set up... ...it's time to start to play. FOR THE GLORY! Hey, were you asleep?! I'll have to explain it all over again!@Card Wars
Finn@Doesn't matter. Let's just play.@Card Wars
Jake@But if you don't know the rules then you're gonna lose in the first couple rounds, like Lady always does! And then you'll hate the game, and then you'll hate me, and then... and then...@Card Wars
Finn@You think you're gonna win? I'm gonna crush you! Party-dance-style, dweeb!@Card Wars
Jake@Haha! Bring it!@Card Wars
Finn@So... how do I get my land on the map?@Card Wars
Jake@Oh... you, uh, floop your land cards.@Card Wars
Finn@Uh...@Card Wars
Jake@Keep those honeys hidden, or I'll get a strategic advantage!@Card Wars
Finn@Oh! Hmmm...@Card Wars
Jake@Okay, I go first. I floop the Silo of Truth!@Card Wars
Finn@Hey!!@Card Wars
Jake@Pfff, you got really lame cards. Hmm. I'll take the Cerebral Bloodstorm, though.@Card Wars
Finn@Huh?@Card Wars
Jake@Okay, now it's the battle phase. I'm attackin' your schoolhouse with my Husker Knights. And I'm castin' Cerebral Bloodstorm! So, what'll you use to defend?@Card Wars
Finn@Uh... Can my Cool Dog and Ancient Scholar defeat your Husker Knights?@Card Wars
Jake@Of course not!@Card Wars
Finn@Hmm. Then I floop the Pig.@Card Wars
Jake@What?!@Card Wars
Finn@What?@Card Wars
Jake@Okay... okay, first of all, you don't floop a creature to make it fight. You activate a creature.@Card Wars
Finn@Hmm. No. It says I can floop the Pig. See?@Card Wars
Jake@No... He's eating all my cornfields! My Husker Knights draw energy from corn!@Card Wars
Finn@And, since I'm not actually attacking, your Cerebral Bloodstorm only does damage... to your own kingdom's troops.@Card Wars
Jake@You just wiped out my entire attack!!@Card Wars
Finn@What do you expect if all your power units come from corn? Pigs eat corn, dude. Cornfields stink.@Card Wars
Jake@CORNFIELDS ARE AWESOME! What makes you think you know so much about Card Wars?!@Card Wars
Finn@It's just logic!@Card Wars
Jake@...Your turn.@Card Wars
Finn@Hmm...@Card Wars
Jake@You're supposed to discard a card and pick up a new one first.@Card Wars
Finn@Oh. Right.@Card Wars
Jake@Look at you. You're a babe in the woods. Your beginner's luck ends this round!@Card Wars
Finn@Hmm.@Card Wars
Jake@Spirit Tower?! And the Cave of Solitude?!@Card Wars
Finn@Now my battle phase begins. I activate my Ancient Scholar... to begin studying. And I also move my Pig to the Cave of Solitude so he can take a nap.@Card Wars
Jake@That's it? You're not attacking?@Card Wars
Finn@I'll attack on a different turn.@Card Wars
Jake@HA! Then the seas have aligned and the five winds waft the smell of victory to my palace doors! I cast Field of Nightmares and activate my Legion of Earlings to scare your Pig to death!@Card Wars
Finn@My Pig's in the Cave of Solitude.@Card Wars
Jake@Um... I cast Teleport—to move your Pig to the empty field so I can attack 'im!@Card Wars
Finn@Uh... wouldn't Teleport only work on your own creatures?@Card Wars
Jake@You're right. I'm gonna slay that Pig, though!@Card Wars
Finn@How? You don't have any creatures that can touch 'im! Face it, man. I'm the cool guy.@Card Wars
Jake@Hmm. You're the cool guy, huh? Well, lemme make it a little hot for you, then. Heh heh heh heh... I floop the Volcano!@Card Wars
Finn@What?! That'll destroy your kingdom too, won't it?!@Card Wars
Jake@Hmm. Maybe.@Card Wars
Finn@Aah!! My Pig!!@Card Wars
Jake@The Pig is dead. Now I reconstitute my cornfields using the Reclaim Landscape spell! My Husker Knights revive! And I still have my battle phase! Hiding in the Useless Swamp... the Immortal Maize Walker!@Card Wars
Immortal Maize Walker@I LOVE CORN!@Card Wars
Jake@Cornfields give the Immortal Maize Walker triple damage.@Card Wars
Finn@Uhh...@Card Wars
Jake@I told you cornfields are awesome! Your Ancient Scholar and Cool Dog won't survive this time!@Card Wars
Finn@Actually, my Ancient Scholar's been studying the Raise the Dead ability.@Card Wars
Jake@So what?@Card Wars
Finn@So, my Ancient Scholar raises the dead. I floop the Pig.@Card Wars
Jake@NOOOOO!@Card Wars
Finn@Look! My Tower's doin' a thing!@Card Wars
Immortal Maize Walker@HOMINY, HOMINY, HOMINY!@Card Wars
Jake@YOU GANKED MY SPIRIT WALKER! AAAAGH!!!@Card Wars
Finn@Uh... Maybe we should take a break?@Card Wars
Jake@Your turn.@Card Wars
Finn@Huh?!@Card Wars
Jake@YOU PLAY! YOU PLAY!@Card Wars
Finn@Oh, zing.@Card Wars
BMO@I do not play such games... with Jake.@Card Wars
Finn@Sorry! I gotta use the boy-style room! BMO! BMO!@Card Wars
BMO@BMO chop! If this were a real attack, you'd be dead.@Card Wars
Finn@BMO! Jake's acting banununununus!@Card Wars
BMO@Oh, no! Are you winning the game of Card Wars?@Card Wars
Finn@Yeah!@Card Wars
BMO@That's terrible! If Jake loses the game, he gets super depressed! When I beat him, he wouldn't talk to me for a month!@Card Wars
Finn@What?! I only played so he wouldn't be bummed!@Card Wars
BMO@Finn, you must take a dive.@Card Wars
Finn@Okay, I'll try. But... I'm a Card Wars super Amadeus!@Card Wars
Jake@Play...the...game.@Card Wars
Finn@Grob. Better make this look good. Alright, Jake. Prepare for my ultimo attack!@Card Wars
Jake@Well... I've still got my Wandering Bald Man. Oh, no.@Card Wars
Finn@I need to get rid of my Pig so Jake can reconstitute his cornfields. I activate the Pig—to attack your Wandering Bald Man.@Card Wars
Jake@Well, that's stupid. Just attack with the Immortal Maize Walker and get the game over with.@Card Wars
Finn@No way! You've underestimated me and my Pig all day!@Card Wars
Finn@Please lose. Please lose!@Card Wars
Finn@Noooo!@Card Wars
Jake@I...@Card Wars
Jake@OHHH-HO! Ohhh, oh, yeah! Pigs can't leave mud landscapes once they're on them! Hahaha! The Pig is mine! First, I'll play Reclaim Landscape, then I cast Summon Archer Dan!@Card Wars
Finn@Whoa. Math.@Card Wars
Finn@My boys!@Card Wars
Jake@You have no creatures left. That's the game, boyee!! The five winds blow through cornfields once again! For the glory of Jakoria!@Card Wars
Finn@Heh. You got me.@Card Wars
Jake@In yo' face! It's time to drink up! It looks like you are the dweeb and I'm the cool guy! Is it... too gross for you, man?@Card Wars
Finn@No, no. I gotta take what's coming to me. Hey... Not that bad! I like it!@Card Wars
Jake@WHAT?!@Card Wars
Finn@You want a taste?@Card Wars
Jake@AW, IT'S GROSS!@Card Wars
Finn@In your face, dweeb!@Card Wars
Magic Man@Hey, friend. Don't be afraid. I'm a gypsy child like you, running wild and crazy! Hold on, wow... a falling star. Hm, it's too far though. MAGIC! You're welcome. Hm... oh... there... wait! Oh, Glob.@Sons of Mars
Gob@He's here somewhere, my brothers. Glob, can you see Magic Man on the sensor?@Sons of Mars
Glob@Yes, Gob. Our little brother is very close.@Sons of Mars
Grob@Hey, flip me!@Sons of Mars
Glob@Okay.@Sons of Mars
Grob@I'm gonna activate the thingy that drains his magic juice.@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@My juice! Not... flowing... right...! Dream on, honey! You can't catch this! Magic, away! Whoops!@Sons of Mars
Grob@I think I see him.@Sons of Mars
Grod@Yes, I see him as well.@Sons of Mars
Glob@Hey, guys?@Sons of Mars
Other heads@What, Glob?@Sons of Mars
Glob@...Nothing, never mind.@Sons of Mars
Jake@Wait, wait! Shh, shh, shh! Shush!@Sons of Mars
Finn@I wasn't...@Sons of Mars
Jake@You hear that? It was totally silent for, like, a whole second!@Sons of Mars
Finn@Huh. Oh, yeah! Cool.@Sons of Mars
Jake@Sometimes, we get so wrapped up battling stuff, we forget the...Ooomph!@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@Aah! Ooh! Waaa-zoo!@Sons of Mars
Finn@Hey...@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@Shhh.@Sons of Mars
Grob Gob Glob Grod@Arise. Magic Man. You caused nothing but turmoil and chaos to us on Mars. We hoped banishing you to this world would help you see alike to our Utopian supersociety. Now, tell us, what have you learned in these past two hundred years?@Sons of Mars
Jake@Are you guys talking to me?@Sons of Mars
Glob@You know you made life on Mars a nightmare!@Sons of Mars
Gob@Now we must return you to Mars, where vengeance awaits thee.@Sons of Mars
Finn@That's not-@Sons of Mars
Finn@Magic Man! Get UP!@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@Did it work? Is he gone?@Sons of Mars
Finn@Hee-yup-hoop! They took my friend to Mars! Fly me there and help me save him!@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't. See? The transfer drained me. I can probably barely float. So, I just gotta wait till they kill your friend! See ya!@Sons of Mars
Finn@What do you mean, KILL?@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@They're gonna put him on trial for my crimes! Ain't nobody gonna pardon these crimes on my head. Not even the King of Mars! And once he's dead, my magic juice will return to my body. Flowing through me like moonlight through the ghost dance.@Sons of Mars
Finn@SQUEEZE!!!!@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@I wish I could help. Except I don't!@Sons of Mars
Finn@You succubutt!@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@C'mon, let's go to my house. C'MON, LET'S GO TO MY HOUSE!!@Sons of Mars
Finn@How long have you had this house?@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@Yes, that is true!@Sons of Mars
Finn@Well, I bet there's something in here that could help me save Jake.@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@There is, but you'll never make it work.@Sons of Mars
Finn@What?! Where is it?@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@I don't know! Have you seen my trash palace?@Sons of Mars
Finn@Yeah, what's the deal? This place is wrecked. Eeeew, ew! What am I stepping in??@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@That's where I blow my nose all day!@Sons of Mars
Finn@Ugh!@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@Yes, welcome to my tower of light! Everyone is welcome to share this magic kingdom. Squirrels, black mold, worms, poison ivy... tiny manticore!@Sons of Mars
Tiny Manticore@Help me, you coward!@Sons of Mars
Finn@Magic Man, what is your deal for real?@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@You tell me.@Sons of Mars
Finn@Well, for one, I think this house is a reflection of your sick brain. Look at this. Yuk. Who's this you're standing with in this picture?@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@Memories drift in and out of my mind... And the little people get left behind...So whatever!!@Sons of Mars
Finn@...all right. Well, I'm gonna keep digging through this stuff til I find what you're taking about.@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@It's downstairs.@Sons of Mars
Finn@What?@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@My special thing. Whoa! Aaaaagh!@Sons of Mars
Finn@Holy crepes.@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@Aah! Tada! C'mon. That's the thing. My special thing. A Martian transporter.@Sons of Mars
Finn@This can take me to Mars?!@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@Yeah. My brothers gave it to me when they banished me to earth. They thought I'd learn love and use it to go back home.@Sons of Mars
Finn@How does it work?@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@You put your hands on those thingies and think stuff about people. But it's broken! Hasn't worked in 200 years.@Sons of Mars
Finn@But... It has to work. It has to. For Jake.@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@Huzzah??@Sons of Mars
Finn@YAAAH! WHOOOOOOAAA!!!@Sons of Mars
Gob@Citizens of Mars, King of Mars... Today the most notorious fiend in Martian history stands before us—Magic Man.@Sons of Mars
Finn@Stop!@Sons of Mars
Gob@Turn on the dark. Okay, so we don't have footage of these crimes. But Grod's pretty good at drawing, so... Plague of shadows. Magic Man brought our shadows to life. They attacked us, and ravaged Mars. Very impressive, Grod.@Sons of Mars
Grod@Thanks bro.@Sons of Mars
Gob@To the plague of the oneness. As we gathered to hold hands and sing our community song, Magic Man cast an evil spell that made our arms grow together. Much suffering ensued. And what about that one time when he turned all the water into hair, and we all got so thirsty we drank it? And when we drank it, we went bald! Many of us did not recover and to this day, hide our losses behind groovy headgear. Dark off please.@Sons of Mars
Abe Lincoln@Magic Man, it bums me out to see this. I remember when you were really cool, before that night you spent on Olympus Mons with Margles.@Sons of Mars
Finn@Aw, man. Force field.@Sons of Mars
Abe Lincoln@What happened, Magic? Why did you go crazy? If you had just learned to care about living things again, you could have come back whenever you wanted!@Sons of Mars
Jake@Well, you guys are missing some important details. I'm Jake the Dog! Listen! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!@Sons of Mars
Abe Lincoln@You sad Magic Man. Instead, you bummed around Ooo, acting like a jerk for 200 years.@Sons of Mars
Jake@Yeah, that's true, except I'm not Magic Man!@Sons of Mars
Abe Lincoln@Now! Ready the Wand of Disbursement!@Sons of Mars
Grob Gob Glob Grod@Ready.@Sons of Mars
Abe Lincoln@Space Dome, open!@Sons of Mars
Finn@Oh snap.@Sons of Mars
Abe Lincoln@Magic Man, I give you two choices. One is total annihilation. The wand will touch you, and your soul will meet with Death. The second is to use the power of the wand to convert your body to living stardust, where your consciousness will be jettisoned into the infinite cosmos, on an endless journey of wonder and DISCOVERYYYYYY!!!!!@Sons of Mars
Jake@Whoa. That second one sounds pretty cool. I mean, yeah. I'm way into that. Except...oh...I would really miss my best friend. His name is Finn, and I think it would mess him up if I wasn't around.@Sons of Mars
Abe Lincoln@Wait. Did you say you would miss someone?@Sons of Mars
Jake@Yeah.@Sons of Mars
Abe Lincoln@And that someone would miss you?@Sons of Mars
Finn@Yeah that's ME, you dishrags!@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@I win again, just like always!@Sons of Mars
Finn@Jakey! No!@Sons of Mars
Gob@Look!@Sons of Mars
Grob@It's the dog!@Sons of Mars
Grod@The one you were prophesied to meet!@Sons of Mars
Finn@I don't care none for that mess. This wouldn't have globbed if you'd just...listened to my bro! You bunked up, King of Mars! The wisest, most honest super being of all time just put an innocent dog to deads!@Sons of Mars
Abe Lincoln@You're right, Finn the Human. My judgement was less than the standard by which I judge my peers. Of which I have none. I will retrieve your friend from the 37th Dead World. Death.@Sons of Mars
Death@King of Mars. What's your business?@Sons of Mars
Abe Lincoln@I need this one back.@Sons of Mars
Death@What will you give me for him?@Sons of Mars
Death@Not this time, your majesty.@Sons of Mars
Abe Lincoln@In that case, I offer my immortality.@Sons of Mars
Death@Deal.@Sons of Mars
Jake@Huh? Hey, I'm alive!@Sons of Mars
Finn@Yay! King of Mars saved you!@Sons of Mars
Grob Gob Glob Grod@Yes, but at what cost?@Sons of Mars
Finn@Oh, man. Should we go get Magic Man?@Sons of Mars
Grob Gob Glob Grod@No. I lost a friend. I cannot lose my brother, as well. Hey! What? Where did he go??@Sons of Mars
Finn@EAT MY SKIDS! YAAAAH!@Sons of Mars
Magic Man@Oh, Margles.@Sons of Mars
Finn@MAGIC MAN!@Sons of Mars
Tiny Manticore@You fat coward!@Sons of Mars
Finn@Go! Get out of here, tiny manticore!@Sons of Mars
Tiny Manticore@Whatevs. I didn't need your pity help!@Sons of Mars
Finn@Jeez. What?@Sons of Mars
Tiny Manticore@I am the true coward. Hiding from sincere expressions like a vampire in the nude who hides from the light. Thank you, brave hero. I was freed from bottle jail, but my new prison...is shame. MY NEW PRISON IS SHAAAAME!!!@Sons of Mars
Finn@What's he saying?@Sons of Mars
Jake@He said his new prison is shame.@Sons of Mars
Finn@Well, looks like your new house is done. Whoop! Jake! You wanna check out the new house?@Burning Low
Jake@Naah, don't let me interrupt you. You two have fun.@Burning Low
Flame Princess@I wanna see inside! I love it!@Burning Low
Finn@Great! This doesn't hurt as bad as it used to. Oh gob! Oh gob! Oh gob!@Burning Low
Jake@Finn!@Burning Low
Finn@Haha, I'm okay!@Burning Low
Flame Princess@Hmmmm...@Burning Low
Flame Princess@Oh! Do the thing that I like.@Burning Low
Jake@Now do the thing I like.@Burning Low
Jake@Hehehe, classic. Alright Finn, that's enough.@Burning Low
Flame Princess@Thank you for building my new home, Finn. I'm so happy.@Burning Low
Finn@You... wanna hug?@Burning Low
Flame Princess@Yes.@Burning Low
Jake@Woah! Hold on "mama."@Burning Low
Jake@Okay bro, tin foil's on. You can hug now.@Burning Low
Finn@Bye.@Burning Low
Flame Princess@Bye, Finn.@Burning Low
Finn@Bye!@Burning Low
Jake@Looks like your date went pretty good buddy.@Burning Low
Finn@Uh... I don't know, was the hug okay? Give me some tips man.@Burning Low
Jake@Bro, you gotta let things take their natural path. Look, look , let me explain some junk about dating. Right now, , you're at Tier 1, which is hugging. But pretty soon, you'll be at Tier 2, which is smooching. Then down the road , you'll make it to Tier 5, where she'll let you discover all fifteen feet of her loong, beautiful stomach. Then after awhile, you'll make it to Tier 8 , where you touch her horn for the very first time. Very special.@Burning Low
Finn@What about Tier 15?@Burning Low
Jake@You stay away from that! Do not do Tier 15!@Burning Low
Finn@Dude, I got no idea what you're talking about.@Burning Low
Jake@Don't worry about it dude, just let things naturally move to Tier 2. Oh and um, you need a shower dude.@Burning Low
Finn@What?! Oh gross.@Burning Low
Finn@Do you think Flame Princess could smell me?@Burning Low
Jake@Probably.@Burning Low
Finn@Crup.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@'Sup, guys?@Burning Low
Finn and Jake@Princess Bubblegum?!@Burning Low
Jake@What are you doing here?@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Collecting taxes, you guys weren't home. So I let myself in.@Burning Low
Jake@Oh.@Burning Low
Finn@I'm gonna take a shower. Princess, do not inhale!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@What? Why?@Burning Low
Finn@Just don't. Hyap!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@What's that all about?@Burning Low
Jake@Aah, he's just smelly from a day of running around with his lady-friend.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Ooh, a lady-friend, do tell.@Burning Low
Jake@Uh, I shouldn't say. It's his business.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, come on, you can tell me.@Burning Low
Jake@That's his personal biz, you gotta respect the man's p-biz.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Okay, you're right, I'll respect it.@Burning Low
Jake@Flame Princess! He's hanging out with Flame Princess!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@What?!@Burning Low
Jake@And I don't mean to be telling stories out of school. But pretty soon, they're gonna be taking it to Tier 2.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@No, this isn't possible.@Burning Low
Jake@Oh, it's possible.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@I just never thought, Flame Princess. I-uh-I have to go.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Morrow!@Burning Low
Jake@Mmm, weird.@Burning Low
BMO@Guess who's late for their video chat.@Burning Low
Jake@President Porpoise!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@No, no. Oh gob, I thought I'd be ready for this.@Burning Low
Finn@Yyyaawn! Whoop. Jake, I'm going to see Flame Princess, be back later.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Finn!@Burning Low
Jake@Ok Princess, you need to stop breaking in here.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@I have something important to tell you. About relationships.@Burning Low
Finn@Ah, that's okay, Princess.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@I just hope, you'll understand. Relationships are like layers of sedimentary rock.......@Burning Low
Finn@Jake, Flame Princess is waiting for me. I'm gonna bounce out.@Burning Low
Jake@Uh, ok, Tier 2 baby!@Burning Low
Finn@Word.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@If too much frustration builds, the magma will erupt causing a catastrophic super-stratum of igneous rock to form......@Burning Low
Jake@What? Where am I?@Burning Low
Mini-snowman@Jake, you're president now!@Burning Low
Jake@Oh my glosh!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Jake!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Wake up!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Jake, where's Finn?@Burning Low
Jake@He stepped out.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Will you tell him why he can't see Flame Princess anymore?@Burning Low
Jake@Oh, oh! I see what's going on here!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Great! I cannot stress how important it is that they not see each other.@Burning Low
Jake@Oh man, PB is totally jealous of Flame Princess!@Burning Low
BMO@Jump, punch, kick, kick!@Burning Low
Jake@What's up man?@Burning Low
Finn@Yo, dude! So what did Princess Bubblegum want?@Burning Low
Jake@She doesn't want you see Flame Princess anymore. She's crazy jealous!@Burning Low
Jake@So, you at Tier 2 yet?@Burning Low
Finn@I got about five hugs, does that count?@Burning Low
Jake@Nnoope.@Burning Low
Finn@Uhaah.. Well, I'm still at Tier 1.@Burning Low
Jake@I know exactly what'll get you Tier 2.... A "sappy poem." @Burning Low
Jake@Say something about her "spectrum."@Burning Low
Finn@Ee-eww! Let's see.... She's bright. She's beautiful. She makes me feel... confused, l-like something's filling up my chest, like I can't breathe, is it because she's so.. dangerous? Glob, Jake, I can't stand it!@Burning Low
Finn@Inspiration...@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Finn!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Whatcha doin'?@Burning Low
Finn@Oh, uh, hi, Princess. I'm, uhh, writing something for Jake.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, well, speaking of Jake. Did he explain everything to you?@Burning Low
Finn@Yyeah.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@And you understand?@Burning Low
Finn@Yeah, I understand.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Finn, sometimes you want someone and you want to kiss them, and be with them. But you can't, because responsibility demands sacrifice.@Burning Low
Finn@What are you trying to say?!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@I'm trying to say that you're a hero, Finn. You're my hero. So, I'm glad you understand why you can't be with Flame Princess.@Burning Low
Finn@Grr... Bubblegum! I can't do this anymore!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@What?@Burning Low
Finn@Now you like me?!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Finn, what are you talking about?@Burning Low
Finn@What am I talking about?! PB, I was.... geh...eh.. I was in love with you! Okay?! And you didn't love me back! Now I'm ready to move on, and it's like...rrmph!! You're gonna build me up all over again! Well, I'm done! I'm done.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, no!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Finn! Jake, where's Finn? Is he with Flame Princess?@Burning Low
Jake@Back off, Bubblegum! That's his "man's biz."@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Is he with her?! Or not?!@Burning Low
Jake@You heartless monster! Do you have any idea how much he's CRIED OVER YOU? Finn deserves to be happy, even if his blooping face gets burned off! You should be ashamed! You're SICK!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@What are you..? This isn't about some petty love triangle! Flame Princess is physically unstable! Her elemental matrix can't handle extreme romance! Glob, if Finn tries to kiss her, she'll burn so hot, she'll melt right through the planet's crust, down through the molten core, then she'll be thrown back and forth by gravity until she burns out the world from the inside! Why do you think I had her father keep her locked up?!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Will you take me to them?@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Faster!@Burning Low
Finn@Your wavelengths are my weakness, your emissions are what I've been missing.@Burning Low
Flame Princess@Ahhh.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@No!@Burning Low
Finn@Ohhhh-uh, Flame Princess!@Burning Low
Finn@FLAME PRINCESS!@Burning Low
Jake@Finn!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Finn, there's no time! You have to...@Burning Low
Jake@Are you alright?@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Finn!@Burning Low
Finn@Ohhh-tsst. Flame Princess!@Burning Low
Jake@It's hot!@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Wait, wait! Don't move. This is good! If you stay on the hole for 24.8 seconds, the reaction will be deprived of oxygen. She'll go out.@Burning Low
Jake@Geh.. What about Finn?@Burning Low
Finn@Hey! What's wrong? Please, say something. Please... I need you... to be okay.@Burning Low
Flame Princess@Huh, ummm.@Burning Low
Finn@Are you okay?@Burning Low
Flame Princess@I'm okay. I'm okay.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@She's stabilized. We're safe... for now.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, Finn.@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@What?@Burning Low
Jake@Jeeeaalous?@Burning Low
Princess Bubblegum@Shut up.@Burning Low
BMO@Haha! Take that, Master Chen!@BMO Noire
Finn@JAAAAKE!@BMO Noire
Jake@What?@BMO Noire
Finn@Jake, did you hide my sock?@BMO Noire
Jake@No, man, I told you,@BMO Noire
Jake@I don't do that kinda stuff anymore.@BMO Noire
Finn@So, what? It just magically disappeared?@BMO Noire
Jake@I don't know...@BMO Noire
Jake@Maybe.@BMO Noire
Finn@Is that just a cute way of saying you took it?@BMO Noire
Jake@No!@BMO Noire
Finn@Why don't you just help me find my sock?@BMO Noire
Jake@Oh, Finn lost his sock! Everybody stop what you're doing and help Finn find his precious sock!@BMO Noire
BMO@It looked like a tough case to crack. But I hate to see good friends fight.@BMO Noire
BMO@So I decided to take the case.@BMO Noire
BMO@Hmm...@BMO Noire
BMO@Ronnie!@BMO Noire
BMO@It looked like I had a guilty mouse.@BMO Noire
BMO@Huh!@BMO Noire
BMO@Hello, Ronnie.@BMO Noire
BMO@What do you want, BMO?@BMO Noire
BMO@Where is Finn's sock?@BMO Noire
BMO@I don't know what you're talking about, BMO. I didn't do nothin'. Leave me alone!@BMO Noire
BMO@I knew that lipstick anywhere. @BMO Noire
BMO@How is Lorraine?@BMO Noire
BMO@You stay away from her! She is with me now, do you hear?@BMO Noire
BMO@Calm down, big guy. Me and Lorraine are dinosaur bones.@BMO Noire
BMO@Good, 'cause I would be so jealous.@BMO Noire
BMO@Just tell me where the sock is, and I will let you go.@BMO Noire
BMO@I don't know, man.@BMO Noire
BMO@What if I put some knuckle in your eyeballs? Would that help you think?@BMO Noire
BMO@Ok! Ok! Umm...@BMO Noire
BMO@It looks like a grape juice stain on his sock; check the pantry.@BMO Noire
BMO@Of course I didn't trust Ronnie, but I had no other leads. Maybe the grape juice had some secrets to tell me. Or maybe Ronnie was just pulling my hair.@BMO Noire
BMO@Just as I thought, not even opened. I fell right into his trap.@BMO Noire
BMO@Let me out, you! I'll get you! Piece of... you! Ronnie! Officer Davis! Thank goodness. I...@BMO Noire
BMO@BMO, what are you doing here?@BMO Noire
BMO@Looking for Finn's socks, same as you.@BMO Noire
BMO@We got this to under control. Stay out of police business, or you will be the one behind bars.@BMO Noire
BMO@I didn't listen to that cop. I needed to find Ronnie, and I knew just the lady who could lead me to him. She looked as beautiful as ever.@BMO Noire
BMO@Where is the sock, Lorraine?@BMO Noire
BMO@What makes you think I know?@BMO Noire
BMO@I saw your lipstick on his fur, so don't act so cute.@BMO Noire
BMO@Sounds like someone's jealous, no?@BMO Noire
BMO@Don't count on it, Lorraine. Now tell me where Ronnie is.@BMO Noire
BMO@Ha! You think it was Ronnie? Maybe if he was man enough to steal a sock, I wouldn't have to spend my nights with Bebe.@BMO Noire
BMO@Bebe? So you're saying Bebe is man enough?@BMO Noire
BMO@What? No, you're putting words in my mouth. Bebe doesn't know anything about Finn's sock.@BMO Noire
BMO@Finn's sock? How did you know it was Finn's sock? I never said whose sock was stolen, Lorraine.@BMO Noire
BMO@Uh... uh... I heard it on the TV news.@BMO Noire
BMO@No dice, sweet beak. Officer Davis has this case under tight wraps.@BMO Noire
BMO@Oh, fine, Bebe stole the sock. Oh, BMO, can't you just forget about it?@BMO Noire
BMO@Sorry, lady, forgetting ain't in my job description. Ha ha ha!@BMO Noire
BMO@Does that mean you still remember... us?@BMO Noire
BMO@... Hahaha! Same old Lorraine.@BMO Noire
BMO@Well, don't tell Ronnie about me and Bebe. You know how he gets when he's jealous.@BMO Noire
BMO@Bebe owned Bebe's, a dance club downtown. He yells at ladies!@BMO Noire
BMO@Wake up, brainiac.@BMO Noire
BMO@BMO? Uh...uh...auh!@BMO Noire
BMO@Where is the sock, Bebe?@BMO Noire
BMO@Uh ... I don't know nothing about socks!@BMO Noire
BMO@Don't play dumb, Bebe! Don't play dumb with me!@BMO Noire
BMO@I talked to Lorraine, Bebe. She sold you out, dumb dumb!@BMO Noire
BMO@No! She-she wouldn't do that! It wasn't me, I swear! It was Ronnie!@BMO Noire
BMO@Ronnie? But why?@BMO Noire
BMO@I don't know, man! I don't know! Oh, Lorraine!@BMO Noire
BMO@I'm gonna go wash this shmutz off my grabbers. When I get back, you better start talking sense!@BMO Noire
BMO@It wasn't adding up. Why would Ronnie swipe the sock? And why would Lorraine finger Bebe? Sure, he's a dirt bag born out of a mother, but who's not?@BMO Noire
BMO@I don't really get it.@BMO Noire
BMO@Maybe it was time to cut my losses.@BMO Noire
BMO@Come on, Bebe, let's get you cleaned up. Bebe?@BMO Noire
BMO@Bebe! Dead. This doesn't look good. I'd better hightail it!@BMO Noire
BMO@Huh? The cops!? It was a setup!@BMO Noire
BMO@Oh no! Bang, bang! Pew, pew, pew!@BMO Noire
Jake@Hey, has anyone seen BMO? BMO? Where's BMO?@BMO Noire
BMO@Hello?@BMO Noire
Finn@I'm worried about BMO.@BMO Noire
BMO@This is real.@BMO Noire
Jake@BMO!@BMO Noire

Different BMO@Hello. @BMO Noire
Neptr@Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey, BMO. Wake up, buddy. Are you alright?@BMO Noire
BMO@Neptr? I feel like I got hit with a Dracula by King Kong.@BMO Noire
Neptr@Whoa, sorry, man. You want some pie or something?@BMO Noire
BMO@Sorry, I gotta run. The cops are after me. Have you seen any down here?@BMO Noire
Neptr@Nah, no one's been down here all day except me, you, and Ronnie.@BMO Noire
BMO@What?! What was Ronnie doing down here?!@BMO Noire
Neptr@I don't know, but now my sensors indicate that some treasure is missing ...about a sock's worth.@BMO Noire
BMO@That's it! That's why Ronnie took the sock To carry stolen treasure in with! He had to whack Bebe to keep him from squealing, then he pinned the rap on me.@BMO Noire
Neptr@Bebe's dead?@BMO Noire
BMO@Listen, Neptr you better lay low for awhile. I'm gonna go find Ronnie . I've got a score to settle.@BMO Noire
Neptr@Hey, BMO. We should hang out more. We're both robots.@BMO Noire
BMO@No, Neptr. I am not like you.@BMO Noire
BMO@Ronnie?@BMO Noire
BMO@Evening, BMO.@BMO Noire
BMO@Don't worry, buddy. You're off the hook. We know it was Ronnie who killed Bebe and snatched the treasure . We found this confession on him after the shootout.@BMO Noire
BMO@Hmmmmm...what about the sock?@BMO Noire
BMO@Forget the sock, BMO. The case is closed. Let it go, buddy. It's over.@BMO Noire
BMO@Maybe he was right. But I just couldn't shake the feeling that, somehow, this case had slipped right through my fingers. Lipstick?@BMO Noire
BMO@Lorraine!@BMO Noire
BMO@BMO?@BMO Noire
BMO@Get back here with that treasure, Lorraine!@BMO Noire
BMO@Sorry, BMO. I earned this loot. Those chumps were not framing themselves. See you around, BMO.@BMO Noire
BMO@Lorraine, wait! What about the sock, Lorraine?@BMO Noire
BMO@Oh, that old thing? I hid that where no one would ever find it in our secret, grown-up kissing spot. Remember?@BMO Noire
BMO@It was good to see you again, BMO . Till next time.@BMO Noire
BMO@Till next time, Lorraine.@BMO Noire
Jake@Ya see, man? That was really fun. You don't need two socks to have fun.@BMO Noire
Finn@Yeah, I guess. But maybe it woulda been more fun with two socks!@BMO Noire
BMO@Finn, Finn! I know where your sock is!@BMO Noire
Finn@Huh?@BMO Noire
BMO@It was in your pillow this whole time! See?@BMO Noire
Finn@Whoa haha! Right on, BMO!@BMO Noire
BMO@Ronnie the mouse stole it, but Lorraine chicken set him up to kill Bebe, but the flatfoot busted Ronnie, and Lorraine skedaddled with the loot, but BMO solved the case!@BMO Noire
Finn@Yay, BMO! Yay! Yeah!@BMO Noire
BMO@Yay, BMO!@BMO Noire

Finn & Jake@My cars are cheap.@Who Would Win
Dream Warrior@But they drive bad when I turn out the lights!@Who Would Win
Finn & Jake@Turn out the lights.@Who Would Win
Dream Warrior@These sweatpants have another name.@Who Would Win
Finn & Jake@Another name.@Who Would Win
Finn@Yeah. Don't you always call sweatpants "give-up-on-life pants," Jake?@Who Would Win
Jake@I do, because peeps need to respect themselves when they leave the house... even if it's just for ice cream, or TP, or whatev.@Who Would Win
Dream Warrior@Two shiny golden apples, ripe enough to bite.@Who Would Win
Finn & Jake@Bite.@Who Would Win
Dream Warrior@That's all I gotta say for now. Get lost.@Who Would Win
Jake@What is going on here, Dream Warrior?@Who Would Win
Finn@Yeah, what's this all about?@Who Would Win
Dream Warrior@Nap's over, sorry.@Who Would Win
Finn@Ow!@Who Would Win
Finn@Whoa. That... was a good nap.@Who Would Win
Jake@Hey, did you dream about Dream Warrior?@Who Would Win
Finn@Yeah. What was he trying to tell us, exactly?@Who Would Win
Jake@I don't know; I didn't get it. But listen, man. I'm sorry I got mad at you. Who cares about my high score at Kompy? It ain't important.@Who Would Win
Finn@No, man. It is important. Being the third best at something is math and deserves respect. Not like I did to Kompy. Anyway, I think we both got cranky after all that training.@Who Would Win
Jake@Well, good thing we're rested, 'cause now we can beat this beast.@Who Would Win
Finn@Yeah. Oh, hey! Look!@Who Would Win

Finn@You ready, man?@Who Would Win
Jake@Yeah, dude!@Who Would Win
Jake@Put your pants on.@Who Would Win
Finn@Okay.@Who Would Win
Jake@Ready?@Ignition Point
Flame Princess@Yes@Ignition Point
Finn@That was awesome! Alright, alright, my turn.@Ignition Point
Flame Princess@You guys are full of magic air.@Ignition Point
Finn@Gross! No! Princess? You, okay?@Ignition Point
Flame Princess@Yeah... It's just the air smells bad from your magic tricks, and now I feel sad. I left all my scented candles at the castle. They'd really cut through the magic stink.@Ignition Point
Jake@Just go back to the Fire Kingdom and get 'em. Problem solved.@Ignition Point
Flame Princess@Then I'll have to see my dad. I'm still mad at him for imprisoning me in that lantern. So UNFAIR!@Ignition Point
Finn@Uh, we can go get 'em.@Ignition Point
Flame Princess@Really? That would be really nice. But don't let my Pops see you. I don't want "His Majesty" thinking I need anything from him.@Ignition Point
Jake@That ain't me.@Ignition Point
Finn & Jake@Whoa!@Ignition Point
Flambo@Oh!@Ignition Point
Jake@Flambo! For a second, I thought the princess was farting.@Ignition Point
Finn@Flambo, we need you to cast Flame Shield on us.@Ignition Point
Flambo@Alright!@Ignition Point
Finn@These candles, must be "They."@Ignition Point
Jake@They smell like an old lady's bathroom.@Ignition Point
Finn@Hey! Don't disrespect my lady!@Ignition Point
Jake@I said that as a compliment. Like, it reminds me of grandma. I love my grandma.@Ignition Point
Furnius@No one comes-sss here. Not since Flame Princess leaved the castle. Now guesssss what we're gonna kill Flame King with?@Ignition Point
Finn@A conspirator with a hiss voice!@Ignition Point
Torcho@How about, water?@Ignition Point
Furnius@Even worsssse, we'll use icccce.@Ignition Point

Torcho@Ice? Why ice?@Ignition Point
Furnius@Cuz it'sss more painful, You sssimpleton! Cold as iccce fallzz. A perfect death for the Flame King.@Ignition Point
Jake@Whoa!@Ignition Point
Finn@Did you hear that?@Ignition Point
Finn@Jake, come on! We gotta stop those guys from killing Flame Princess's dad!@Ignition Point
Jake@Right, right.@Ignition Point
Finn@Dirt bags! Where'd they go?@Ignition Point

Furnius@...my father's life, now wears his crown.@Ignition Point
Jake@Dude, the voice@Ignition Point
Finn@We must follow the voice@Ignition Point
Unknown@To die, to sleep; To sleep perchance to dream...@Ignition Point
Finn@Which way is the hiss voice coming from?@Ignition Point
Unknown@...there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what...@Ignition Point
Jake@This way!@Ignition Point
Unknown@...dreams may come.@Ignition Point
Finn@Which way?@Ignition Point
Furnius@I seem to be saying a lot about our super secret plan@Ignition Point
Jake@To the left@Ignition Point
Fire Denizens 1@You!@Ignition Point
Fire Denizens 1@You! You! You!@Ignition Point
Fire Denizens 2@Double you! Double you!@Ignition Point

Fire Denizens 2@Double you! Double you!@Ignition Point

Theater troupe leader@Five minutes are closing everyone, five minutes.@Ignition Point
Finn@I'm sorry, I'm sorry.@Ignition Point
Jalapeño pepper@Oh. Psh, actors.@Ignition Point
Finn@What's going with the costumes?@Ignition Point
Theater troupe member@This is a theater troupe. We're getting rrready to perform for the king. Everyone in the kingdom shall be in attendance. Of course, you know all this being fellow actors from the exact same troupe.@Ignition Point
Jake@I have an idea. We'll go on stage, act like two conspirators, you will have one shoe untied, I'll talk with a hiss voice, we'll talk about how we want to kill the king, as we do these, we'll study the faces of the audience, a move of guilty reactions.@Ignition Point
Finn@That's brilliant!@Ignition Point
Jake@Thanks! It's an original idea, by me.@Ignition Point
Finn@Hey conspirator!@Ignition Point
Jake@Hey co-conspirator!@Ignition Point
Finn@Let's talk about how we're gonna kill the king.@Ignition Point
Jake@Shhhhhh sssssomebody might here our evil plot.@Ignition Point
Flame King@Man, I am so lost.@Ignition Point
Jake@Psst, the audience.@Ignition Point
Jake@You think that's one of them.@Ignition Point
Finn@Maybe, let's keep goin'. So, what are you packin'?@Ignition Point
Jake@Water, man. Enough of it to put out the King's fire.@Ignition Point
Finn@I thinks he's starting to crack. Water? You know what is more painful, if we pour ice in his ear. That's how we'll kill the Flame King.@Ignition Point
Flame King@Psh, kill the Flame King? This is treason disguised as a play! Guards, seized them!@Ignition Point
Finn@What!? No!@Ignition Point
Finn@Please, we were trying to warn you about the assassins!@Ignition Point
Flame King@Hmmmmm, search them!@Ignition Point
Flame Guard@Hmmmm, Huh? Sire! It's your daughter's scented candles.@Ignition Point

Finn@Wait! So, you? You extinguished their dad?@Ignition Point
Finn@And everyone is evil here?@Ignition Point
Flame King@All evil.@Ignition Point
Finn@Then, is Flame Princess evil or maybe chaotic neutral?@Ignition Point
Flame King@She's evil.@Ignition Point
Finn@Okay, so your daughter's evil. We've established that, but do you think if a good guy really liked her, could he, change her to good?@Ignition Point
Flame King@Hmmmmm, well, there'd be penalties to her experience, if she acted out of alignment. But, yes, someone could change her.@Ignition Point
Flame King@Change her to good?@Ignition Point
Finn@Aww...@Ignition Point
Flame King@Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil.... EVIL!!!@Ignition Point
Flame Princess@Aah!@Ignition Point
Flame King@Aah!@Ignition Point
Finn@You getting all bit up by mosquitoes?@The Hard Easy
Jake@I don't know... I'm getting bit up by something.@The Hard Easy
Finn@Man, I can't believe you said this was a good swimming hole.@The Hard Easy
Jake@I said it might be good. It's not, though.@The Hard Easy
Finn@True.@The Hard Easy
Jake@Wanna just go?@The Hard Easy
Finn@Yeah. This place smells like green beans.@The Hard Easy
Mudscamp@My name's Woobeewoo.@The Hard Easy
Jake@Oh, whoa!@The Hard Easy
Woobeewoo@I need your help. My people are in trouble. I'm a mudscamp.@The Hard Easy
Finn@Yeah, Woobeewoo! Of course we'll help. Why didn't you just say something before?@The Hard Easy
Woobeewoo@I'm shy. It took me a while to work up the nerve.@The Hard Easy
Finn@Oh. Right on. You good now?@The Hard Easy
Woobeewoo@We'll see. Come, I'll take you to my village.@The Hard Easy
Woobeewoo@Here we are the village of my people. It doesn't have an official name, but I call it South Woobeewoo. Uh, this way.@The Hard Easy
Woobeewoo@This is the village elder. He'll fill you in on the "deets."@The Hard Easy
Woobeewoo Elder@Greetings, heroes.@The Hard Easy
Jake@Bleehhh! Aw! Ehhh!@The Hard Easy
Woobeewoo Elder@I'm so sorry about that. You know, we--we secrete stink oil all day out our awful-sauce glands. You know, I guess I should have warned you. Anyway, lemme cut the cheese.@The Hard Easy
Woobeewoo on right@Cut to the chase.@The Hard Easy
Woobeewoo Elder@Yes... I mean--I mean, of course "cut to the chase," I mean, for many--for many moons now our village has been under siege by the Mega Frog. He's 100 stories of 110% 10-speed terror, like, bam, like, fresh out the grease. I mean, he chases us all up and down from first base to home, trying to eat us alive. We--we've always managed to escape, but it's c-razy scary, I mean, w-what if you got ate? Think about it. All alone in a stomach full of acid. "Mommy! Mommy, Mommy, help me!" "Billy, is that you? Mommy you sound exactly--" "Mommy you sound exactly like m--" "Mommy, you sound exactly like me!" "Billy, uh--" Anyway. If this keeps up, we'll have to move to the city and get jobs. We don't know how to--how to do anything cool. Look, see, th-they're already practicing, the poor fools. They don't know what they're in for.@The Hard Easy
Jake@Whoa, relax, buddy! You're talkin' to the right couple of guys.@The Hard Easy
Finn@Yeah, man! Me and Jake will bust this Mega Frog up, right up his bumble-stop.@The Hard Easy
Woobeewoo Elder@That is excellent news. I mean, h-here, take this, please. It's not much, b-but it's all we have-- it's--it's a bag of lollies.@The Hard Easy
Jake@That's nice! Thanks, man.@The Hard Easy
Woobeewoo Elder@Now farewell, heroes! We're counting on you... for reals!@The Hard Easy
Jake@Hmm.@The Hard Easy
Finn@Gettin' anything?@The Hard Easy
Jake@Yeah, but it's hard to make out. Could just be some footprints... or an old doodie.@The Hard Easy
Finn@Word... Hey, I have an idea. We can use those lollipops to leave a trail. That way we won't get lost out here.@The Hard Easy
Jake@Yeah, that's a great idea, man. I was just gonna throw 'em all on the ground anyway. Whomp. Whomp. Whomp. Whomp. This way. The thing with frogs is they got a real subtle smell. Kinda like when you open up a new thing of, um... CDRs.@The Hard Easy
Finn@Like... electric celery?@The Hard Easy
Jake@Yeah... but subtler. Mm-HMM! Just as I suspected.@The Hard Easy
Finn@Sweet. These'll take us right to him. Come on, Jake!@The Hard Easy
Finn@Hmm. Huh. We've passed this butt tree, like, three times.@The Hard Easy
Jake@Oh, yeah.@The Hard Easy
Finn@We should probably backtrack--get reoriented and all that.@The Hard Easy
Jake@Word. Wait, these prints are all messed up!@The Hard Easy
Finn@Whoa. Yeah! Guess we better follow the lollipops back. Where's those at?@The Hard Easy
Jake@We ran out of those a while ago.@The Hard Easy
Finn@Snaaaap. Totally lost. Dang! Do you think maybe the Mega Frog made all those footprints on purpose? So we'd use up all our lollies and get totally lost?@The Hard Easy
Jake@What? Nah, man! Frogs are mighty dumb, you know that. He's probably runnin' around like that 'cause he's lost! Plus, we're not even lost. I just gotta stretch up past these trees and see where we're at. Dang. It's all misty! It's kinda nice up here, though. AAAAAAAAH! Man, forget that! I can't see anything through that mist. Plus, I got struck by lightning. We're just gonna have to set up camp and wait out the storm.@The Hard Easy
Finn@Cool! I call fire patrol!@The Hard Easy
Jake@Yeah, me, too!@The Hard Easy
Jake@Do you remember how to make a fire with sticks?@The Hard Easy
Finn@Yeah, man--it's easy. Uhhh, rub 'em together, right?@The Hard Easy
Jake@Oh, yeah.@The Hard Easy
Jake@I don't think it's workin', man.@The Hard Easy
Finn@I think I saw some guy do it like this once.@The Hard Easy
Jake@That's not it. I think you're on to something, though.@The Hard Easy
Finn@Yeah, here we go!@The Hard Easy
Finn@Friction!@The Hard Easy
Jake@Come on, boys, come on!@The Hard Easy
Finn@Mwah! I don't know.@The Hard Easy
Jake@You just gotta get some momentum going. AAAAAAH! Glob-globbing stick! Glob-globbing swamp! AAAAAAAAAAAAH! Oh, hey, you got the fire goin'. Right on!@The Hard Easy
Finn@Jake, how did you--? What the--? It's the Mega Frog! Quick, put the fire out!@The Hard Easy
Finn@Jake, look! He's just sittin' there! What's he doin' out there?@The Hard Easy
Jake@I don't know, but let's pound him while he's vulnerable.@The Hard Easy
Finn@Okay, Sweetles. What?@The Hard Easy
Jake@Whoaa!@The Hard Easy
Finn@Hoi-YAAAH!@The Hard Easy
Finn@Wha--? Jake, wake up. Look!@The Hard Easy
Jake@Ow, my head hurts.@The Hard Easy
Finn@Look at that thing!@The Hard Easy
Jake@Oh, what?! Yeah, . Hey, whoa! That gives me a great idea. We can make a Finn and Jake out of sticks and stuff and lure the Mega Frog out here, then ba-donk him right while he's all confused!@The Hard Easy
Finn@Yeaaaah! That's a great idea, man! That's a great idea, Jake.@The Hard Easy
Jake@Fuh-fuh-fuh... fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh...@The Hard Easy
Finn@What? What is it, Jake?@The Hard Easy

Finn@Wha--? AAAAAAAAAAAAHH! Jake! RUN! Jake, stretch us outta here! Come on, Jake!@The Hard Easy
Finn@Jake, let's hide in this cave. Shmow-tow, dude! That guy's gonna dingle our bones into tapioca pudding!@The Hard Easy
Jake@Finn, that is gross, man! Don't use language like that.@The Hard Easy
Jake@Chomp that!@The Hard Easy
Jake@Aaaah! He's eating me! Aah! Gently eating me! No teeth! Mostly tongue!@The Hard Easy
Finn@Hmm? Hmmm...@The Hard Easy
Woobeewoo (in flashback)@I need your help. My people are in trouble... I'm shy... I mean, he chases us all up and down from first base to home. We've always managed to escape--.@The Hard Easy
Finn (in flashback)@You gettin' anything?@The Hard Easy
Jake (in flashback)@Yeah, but it's hard to make out.@The Hard Easy
Woobeewoo (in flashback)@I'm shy... first base...@The Hard Easy
Jake (in flashback)@Yeah, but it's hard to make out.@The Hard Easy
Woobeewoo (in flashback)@I'm shy.@The Hard Easy
Jake (in flashback)@...it's hard to make out.@The Hard Easy
Finn@Hmmm. That's it! Jake, wait!@The Hard Easy
Jake@Oof! Sick, dude! Huh?@The Hard Easy
Finn@I know how to stop him! Mwah!@The Hard Easy
Prince Huge@Ah, this is rad! I'm hot again! Thanks, little dudes! I really appreciate it!@The Hard Easy
Prince Huge@I don't get it, though... I kissed just about everything I could get my lips on. How come it only worked with you?@The Hard Easy
Finn@You can't break your own curse by kissin' somebody. Somebody's gotta kiss you.@The Hard Easy
Prince Huge@Oh. Weird. Well, thanks, man. I don't know a lot of dudes who'd do that to help a guy out.@The Hard Easy
Finn@Whatevs.@The Hard Easy
Prince Huge@Episode ends@The Hard Easy

Huntress Wizard@What's it look like, ya donk?@Reign of Gunters
Ice King@I know that, I know! Why can't they write it on the sign, though? Why's it all gotta be secret? Let's just put it all out there, huh? Equal distribution of magic to the people! No more symbols! No more initiations! Ya feelin' me, Huntress Wizard?@Reign of Gunters
Huntress Wizard@You tryin' to get killed, Ice King?@Reign of Gunters
Ice King@Uh-uh, I was just steppin' to ya, girl, with my intellectual wizard politics. No, don't go. Well, "Swing at every ball," that's what Jay T. Doggzone says. Hello?@Reign of Gunters
Bufo@...So then he was telling me to beef in the eye of Glob and stuff.@Reign of Gunters
Laser Wizard@Whoa. Did you do it?@Reign of Gunters
Bufo@Heck yes, I did.@Reign of Gunters
Forest Wizard@Yo, I wouldn't do that.@Reign of Gunters
Laser Wizard@Get over it, man. Don't you want to reach the highest initiation of the secret schools?@Reign of Gunters
Forest Wizard@Of course, man. In shadow, we find the light... safely sealed in darkest night. So make sure y'all keep it tight. Wizards only, fools.@Reign of Gunters
Ice King@Keep what tight?@Reign of Gunters
Laser Wizard@A secret you never should've heard, Ice King.@Reign of Gunters
Ice King@Yo. Guys. Chill. I lost my Demonic Wishing Eye. Just get me a new one and I'll jet. I didn't hear nothin' about no weird, secret wizard club that I want to be a part of.@Reign of Gunters
Forest Wizard@Loose lips sink the ships, Ice King.@Reign of Gunters
Bufo@Sorry, man. Nothing personal.@Reign of Gunters
Ice King@Oh, slid— You guys! Ah! Whoa!@Reign of Gunters
Jake@Okay, I give up.@Reign of Gunters

Jake@Hold on, man. Wait. Oh, Glob! This can't be happening!@Reign of Gunters
Finn@Tell me!@Reign of Gunters
Jake@Eh, it's over. We've been conquered.@Reign of Gunters
Finn@Who's been conquered?@Reign of Gunters
Jake@Everyone.@Reign of Gunters
Finn@By the Ice King?@Reign of Gunters
Jake@No, dude! By Gunther.@Reign of Gunters
Finn@Holy shmow! Gimme that! Gunther's heading for the Candy Kingdom! We gotta save them!@Reign of Gunters
Jake@Whoa, okay.@Reign of Gunters
Finn@Hurry, Jake! Wait—I'm still in my pajayjays.@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@Yo, Finn, are you seeing these penguins?@Reign of Gunters
Finn@Yeah, it's Gunther! He's taking over the whole thing!@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@Well, he'll have to beat my Banana Guards and my Gumball Guardians.@Reign of Gunters
Jake@That's not gonna work.@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@What did he say?@Reign of Gunters
Finn@He says your plan is bunk.@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@Well, what's your plan?@Reign of Gunters
Finn@I got a plan.@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@You do?@Reign of Gunters
Finn@When we get there, I'll do my plan in addition to your plan. Two plans. Laters.@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@Uh, alright, so you're not gonna tell me your—@Reign of Gunters
Finn@I'm outies!@Reign of Gunters
Jake@You're not gonna tell her the plan?@Reign of Gunters
Finn@No, I gotta be mysterious.@Reign of Gunters
Jake@What? I thought you weren't into Bubblegum anymore.@Reign of Gunters
Finn@I'm not. But this is how I act now with all the ladies, you see? I keep 'em in a state of confusion. That way, I've always got options in case Flame Princess doesn't work out.@Reign of Gunters
Jake@OH MY GOSH! Where is this coming from?!@Reign of Gunters
Finn@It's called "future farming." I read it in that book you have by Jay T. Doggzone.@Reign of Gunters
Jake@Jay T. Dogg—awww, dude! Don't read that book! It's gonna mess up your brain. I keep that book around for laughs. It's all really bad advice.@Reign of Gunters
Finn@Oh, okay. I'll stop it, then.@Reign of Gunters
Jake@No, well... you can still be mysterious—that's fine.@Reign of Gunters
Finn@What? Now I'm confused.@Reign of Gunters
Jake@Never mind—I didn't say nothin'.@Reign of Gunters
Finn@Hey P-Bubs! Are you ready?@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@Yes. The calvary is standing by.@Reign of Gunters
Finn@Cool. I'm gonna rally some citizens and do this other plan.@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@Okay, but what—?@Reign of Gunters
Finn@Good luck!@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@Jake, what's with all the mystery?@Reign of Gunters
Jake@Uhhh... Oh snap, look out!@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@Banana Guards, defend!@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@Aw, jeez.@Reign of Gunters
Gumball Guardian@Evil presence detected. Must defend candy. Dange— aaah!@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@You'll never get past these walls... I think.@Reign of Gunters
Finn@This... is my plan. I got the Candy Kingdom underground to help me collect all the bottles in the land.@Reign of Gunters
Jake@Breaking news that mystery plan of yours is a smash hit. Because the—of the glass... I guess all they care about is bottles, huh.@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@But what'll happen when they run out of bottles?@Reign of Gunters
Finn@I won't let that happen, Prubbs.@Reign of Gunters
Gunter@We-e-e-e-e-enk...@Reign of Gunters
Finn@Stay back!@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@Wait a minute! Put away your weapons and we'll get you more bottles.@Reign of Gunters
Finn@Peeb! There aren't any bottles left!@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@I have a third plan.@Reign of Gunters
Jake@So, we make them new bottles. Then the Gunthers break the bottles, and then we pick up the glass and make new bottles again?@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@Yup.@Reign of Gunters
Finn@What, like, forever?@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@Yes.@Reign of Gunters
Finn@Bubb, your plan... bunks.@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@Heh, yeah.@Reign of Gunters
Jake@I like it. I got a rhythm goin'!@Reign of Gunters
Gunter@Wenk!@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@What? What do you want? I don't—@Reign of Gunters
Finn@He wants to smash the Gumball Guardian's head!@Reign of Gunters
Princess Bubblegum@We're going to make more bottles. Just wait, okay?@Reign of Gunters
Finn, Jake, and Princess Bubblegum@NO!@Reign of Gunters
Gumball Guardian@Goodbye... Princess!@Reign of Gunters
Ice King@Hey. What's goin' on here? Why's this place all crazy? I was just flying by and— Gunther! You took my stuff!@Reign of Gunters
Gunter@Wenk.@Reign of Gunters
Ice King@That's bad. You know what you get now?!@Reign of Gunters
Gunter@Wenk.@Reign of Gunters
Ice King@That's right, you get the squirty-squirts. Bad, bad. Now take off my Demonic Wishing Eye.@Reign of Gunters
Ice King@Alright, Gunther. Now go home.@Reign of Gunters
Gunter@Wenk.@Reign of Gunters
Ice King@That's right, walk. And while you're walking home, you think about what you did. It's getting worse and worse with him. He just—he hates it when I leave the castle. I'm sorry, guys.@Reign of Gunters
Jake@Uh, dude? Where have you been?@Reign of Gunters
Finn@Yeah, and why are you all jacked up?@Reign of Gunters
Ice King@Heh... well, I got into some crazy wiz biz over in Wizard City. Honestly, I don't even know how I survived. Basically, it was the craziest showdown ever. I— I wish I could tell you all about it, but you know—"Wizards only, fools." Keep it tight.@Reign of Gunters
Ice King@Okay, Gunter! You ready for the show to begin?!@I Remember You
Gunter@Wenk!@I Remember You
Ice King@One, two, three... Gunter! It's rhetorical, Gunter. Marceline's songs are so good! Mmm... Maybe I can get Marceline to write a song with me! Man, if she helped me write a song like that, I'd be crushin' it nonstop with the princesses! Ooh, yeah! Heh! Gunter, you cute little dummy. You know, Gunter, my song is gonna need some dope lyrics to lure the honeys in. Hmm.@I Remember You
Ice King@Jay T. Doggzone always says, "Ladies are drawn to bros with tortured pasts." And I've got a way tortured past! ...I think. I don't really... re... Hmm. Quickly, Gunter! To the "The Past" room!@I Remember You
Ice King@Lot of emotional, powerful stuff in here. Still wet with tears... I'll take some-a' these for lyrical inspiration. So where's Marceline living these days?@I Remember You
Penguin@Wenk.@I Remember You
Ice King@A cave??@I Remember You
Finn@Well, well, well. Looks like the Ice King is up to bad biscuits, brotha.@I Remember You
Jake@Bad biscuits make the baker broke, bro.@I Remember You
Finn@Ice King, you make our job too easy. You ready to roll on this fool?@I Remember You
Jake@Dinner roll!@I Remember You
Ice King@Hello? Anybody home?@I Remember You
Marceline@No... What are you doing here? I told you not to come around me!@I Remember You
Ice King@Uh, yeah, I know, but... I was hoping you could help me write a song—one that could help me get some princess action.@I Remember You
Marceline@I'm not gonna help you pick up on chicks!@I Remember You
Ice King@Come on! We could be a prog rock duo! I'll even split the fans with you. I get the princesses, and you get... whatever it is you're into. Sounds good, yeah, I think it does! Ee-yoop!@I Remember You
Marceline@Hey!!@I Remember You
Ice King@Eh...@I Remember You
Marceline@Get outta here!!@I Remember You
Ice King@Wait! Just let me play you what I've written so far! Oh. Dang it. Tangles in the cord. Sometimes this happens when you fly with it... Tangles are hard... Oh. Aw, aw, geez, no... Oh, no. Ice King's in trouble. Hey, you know what? I'll just hum it for ya. Is that good?@I Remember You
Finn & Jake@Ice King!@I Remember You
Finn@...Wha?@I Remember You
Jake@Oh... You got 'im.@I Remember You
Finn@Nice job, Marceline.@I Remember You
Jake@Your constant harassment of the female gender makes me sick.@I Remember You
Marceline@No, he can stay.@I Remember You
Finn & Jake@Wha?!@I Remember You
Ice King@Yeah, "Wha?!"@I Remember You
Marceline@It's alright. We're working on a song together.@I Remember You
Finn@You don't want us to... ...for you?@I Remember You
Marceline@No, it's okay. You guys can go.@I Remember You
Finn@...Okay... Well... I guess we'll see ya, then...@I Remember You
Finn & Jake@Bye...@I Remember You
Ice King@You know, I kinda like bein' tied up in these cords. Kinda freak-aaaayyy!@I Remember You
Marceline@So what kinda song're we playing?@I Remember You
Ice King@Ooh. I brought these for some inspiration. Just use these to work off of. Y'know, a template.@I Remember You
Marceline@Oookaaaay...@I Remember You
Ice King@Yeah. Yeah, that's good! Keep doin' that! Slime Princess, you're alright. Flame Princess, you're okay. Wildberry Princess could be better. All of the princesses are pretty alright, but... Oh, Bubblegum! You look like a lot of fun! I'm right outside, and that is how I know! Hey, princess, did you get my text with a picture of my awesome gun show? I'm also workin' on my pecs! If you like, I'll send a picture of that, too! Oh, Bubblegum! I really need someone. Or anyone! ...Pretty much anyone. I'm so alone! Won't somebody tell me what's wrong with me?! Anybody! Anybody! Anybody!!! Grod in the sky, please tell me why!!!@I Remember You
Marceline@Stop acting like this!!@I Remember You
Ice King@No, it's just startin' to get good!! Anybody!! Princesses, I command you, love me!! Love me!! Love me!! Love me!!@I Remember You
Marceline@STOP ACTING CRAZY.@I Remember You
Ice King@I JUST WANNA BE LOVED!! Uh-oh. I'm sorry I pushed you. Uh... oh... I'll just stay out of your way. Again, I'm sorry I pushed you.@I Remember You
Marceline@Huh?@I Remember You
Ice King@Whatcha got? An apple?@I Remember You
Marceline@Ugh! You're so annoying, you pitiful old man. I'd like to help you, but I don't know if I can. I thought you were nuts, but you're really really really nuts. Every time I move, eventually, you find me, and start hanging around. Just another lame excuse to see me. Man. It's getting me down. You know, I'm actually glad... to see you! Maybe I'm the one who's... nuts.@I Remember You
Ice King@Hold on! Do you... like me?!@I Remember You
Marceline@...Of course I do, you old jerk!@I Remember You
Ice King@Really? ...Wow. How about... one of these? Ah! Mwah, mwah, mwah...@I Remember You
Marceline@AAAAAGH!!! Not like that!! You don't remember anything, do you... SIMON?@I Remember You
Ice King@What-mon?@I Remember You
Marceline@Why do you even come see me when you don't remember me?! You don't even know who you are!@I Remember You
Ice King@Yes, I do! I am a lyricist! It's all here! On the page! The page in song, baby! On this receipt! On this takeout menu! On these newspapers!@I Remember You
Marceline@Huh? Look! This clipping! This was you, Simon! Before the War!@I Remember You
Ice King@Huh? Heh?@I Remember You
Marceline@This! You took this picture! Grr, you've scribbled all over it... Huh?@I Remember You
Ice King@Ooh, ooh, are they good lyrics? I'll get the keyboard!@I Remember You
Marceline@What? Wait, listen!@I Remember You
Ice King@Yeah, let's go! What's it say? Sing out, sister!@I Remember You
Marceline@"Marceline, is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world? That must be so confusing for a little girl. And I know you're going to need me here with you... but I'm losing myself, and I'm afraid you're going to lose me, too..."@I Remember You
Ice King@Ooh, yeah! Keep it going!@I Remember You
Marceline@Oh! Um... "This magic keeps me alive, but it's making me crazy, and I need to save you, but who's going to save me? Please forgive me for whatever I do ...when I don't remember you."@I Remember You
Ice King@Wow! I wrote that?! Hot stuff!@I Remember You
Marceline@What?! You don't remember what it means?! Look!@I Remember You
Ice King@"Marceline, I can feel myself slipping away. I can't remember what it made me say... but I remember that I saw you frown. I swear, it wasn't me. It was the crown. This magic keeps me—"@I Remember You
Ice King & Marceline@"—alive, but it's making me crazy, and I want to save you, but who's going to save me?! Please forgive me for..."@I Remember You
Jake@What is goin' on in there?!@I Remember You
Finn@...I have no idea.@I Remember You
Ice King & Marceline@"...Please forgive me for whatever I do... when I don't remember you."@I Remember You

Billy@Exhibio Carnotum!@The Lich
Finn@Whoa!@The Lich
Jake@Cool!@The Lich
Finn@What is this this stuff?@The Lich
Billy@Hold on!@The Lich
Booko@Hello, my name is Booko! What you see here is a map of the multiverse! It shows all the known dimensions and the links between each of them. This is the dimension that contains the universe in which we currently reside.@The Lich
Jake@Enhance!@The Lich
Jake@Whoa... Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm...MAKE IT STOP!@The Lich
Booko@Anyways, At the center of the multiverse is a dimension called the Time Room, believed to be the quasi-corporeal dwelling place of the almighty Prismo. The Time Room is the single dimension that exists outside of time. The Time Room produces time waves that are experienced by other dimensions. Some dimensions have permanent links that allow travel to and from. Others become linked temporarily by naturally forming Worm Holes. And others can become linked artificially by magical portals, torn open by items of great power. Once the last gem is inserted into the Enchiridion it will have the power to create a portal to any dimension in the multiverse. An activated portal creates a time dilation in which either end of the portal experiences a temporal synchronization allowing for the safe passage of particles through a non-local region of space-time.@The Lich
Billy@I'm going to push the Lich in there@The Lich
Finn@Whoa... Cool!@The Lich
Jake@Let's go get that gem!@The Lich
Finn@Yeah!@The Lich

Prismo@Actually, it depends on the wish I granted him.@Finn the Human
Finn@"Wish"? @Finn the Human
Prismo@Yeah, he wished for the extinction of all life and I did it. I guess it changed his timeline or something?@Finn the Human
Finn@WHAT?!?! OH GLOB!@Finn the Human
Jake@Whoa, wait a minute. How can that be if I'm still here kickin' it with my main man, Finn?@Finn the Human
Prismo@Oh, that's because you're safe in my time room until you make your wish.@Finn the Human
Finn & Jake@Ohhhh.@Finn the Human
Jake@I wish that life wasn't anymore extinc—@Finn the Human
Finn@Whoa! Wait, Jake. Don't mess this up. Think about it if we wish everything back to normal, the Lich could just jazz it up again.@Finn the Human
Jake@Oh yeah. Jazz.@Finn the Human
Finn@Hmmmm.@Finn the Human
Jake@Hmmmm.@Finn the Human
Finn@I got it! I wish... the Lich... never... even ever existed!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Finn@Mom? Mom, what's wrong?@Finn the Human
Finn's mom@Finn, I need you to do something for me. It's very important. I need you to take the mule into town and sell him for as much as you can.@Finn the Human
Farmworld Finn@What! Sell Bartram? But, I love Bartram. What the heck, Mom!@Finn the Human
Finn's Mother@Shhh! Finn please, just do as I say.@Finn the Human
Trami@Got it?@Finn the Human
Farmworld Finn@Dad?@Finn the Human
Trami@I push you, you fall down.@Finn the Human
Farmworld Finn@The Destiny Gang?@Finn the Human
Finn's Mother@Everything will be fine, Finn, I promise. Now just do as I say.@Finn the Human
Farmworld Finn@I'm sorry, Bartram. I guess Dad must be in real trouble to be doin' this. But, I bet there's a lot o' fine folk lookin' to buy a good mule. Why, I bet I could even come visit sometimes. Won't that be swell, Bartram? Bartram? Dang it Bartram! Bar Bar! What the- Bar Bar, how'd ya get up there? Whoa! Jake, look! Golden crown! Unbelievable! We can sell it and keep Bartram! Bong, bong.@Finn the Human
Farmworld Marceline@Hold it right there!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Finn@Who are you?!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Marceline@I'm a thousand years old and this is my crown!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Finn@Okay, okay! But, um, maybe I could just borrow it for a little while.@Finn the Human
Farmworld Marceline@Noooo! No! Noo! This crown is magic. Bad, terrible magic. Too dangerous for mortal fingies like yours! One thousand years ago, my beloved friend Simon Petrikov gave his life to save this foolish, unworthy planet from annihilation. A frightful bomb was poised to bathe the land in mutagenic horror, but using his mastery of ice and snow, Simon froze the bomb in mid-flight only inches from the ground, where it remains to this very day. Today, ever ripe and ready to blow. But he alone was not saved. Trapped under the giant weight of the enormous bomb, poor Simon perished!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Simon@Little help?@Finn the Human
Farmworld Marceline@And the horrible crown, grieving its lost master, loosed a spasm of magic so wild and crazy the entire earth was buried in ice for four hundred boring years.@Finn the Human
Farmworld Finn@Uhh, none o' that is true, 'cause magic is fake. Daddy says the false prophets of old used cheap parlor tricks to control the people. And to get babes. Like 10 or 12 hot babes each.@Finn the Human
Farmworld Marceline@No! Magic is real!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Finn@Lady! You been down here too long! Why don't you, just let me-@Finn the Human
Farmworld Marceline@Step off! Or I will use this!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Finn@Lady! Quit it with that thing!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Marceline@I'm sorry. You must DIEEEE!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Finn@WAAAAAAAAAAaaaaah… ooo… uuum…@Finn the Human
Farmworld Marceline@Oh, man! This thing! Dang it!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Finn@Go, Jake!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Marceline@Aaah! Go back to the underworld, ya beast.@Finn the Human
Farmworld Finn@Sorry, gotta save my dad!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Marceline@Destroy the world more like it! Dummy. I give up.@Finn the Human
Farmworld Simon@The crown. Go get it.@Finn the Human
Farmworld Marceline@I know you're not really talking to me. I'm not crazy!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Simon@Get the crown! Go get it!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Simon@Get the crown, Marceline! Go get it!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Marceline@I can't. My knees!@Finn the Human
Farmworld Simon@Oh, that's really disappointing I must say. I'm just—uh, whatever, you're really letting me down right now.@Finn the Human
Farmworld Marceline@Okay, alright.@Finn the Human
Farmworld Finn@Cool crown! Who wants a cool crown? I found it on a dead magician dude!@Finn the Human

Trami@No, man! You tell us what to wear!@Finn the Human

Prismo@Yup, totally. You can have anything you want.@Jake the Dog
Jake@I wish for- a sandwich!@Jake the Dog

Ah man, my dad use to make pickles , it's all he use to talk about, he'd obsess about them all the time, when I'd come in from playing he'd be like "Here, Jake, try these!" And they'd be pretty crunchy... actually you'd think they'd be soft but they weren't. I'd be like "Wow dad! You'd made these pretty good!" Yeah, that was dad.@Jake the Dog

Big Destiny@Get off of me, you weirdo!@Jake the Dog
Finn@I am the end and the beginning. I am the hand of madness. Jake?@Jake the Dog
Prismo@Dude, I get out of relationships because I don't want to have a discussion about what we're gonna have for dinner every night! Cause when I'm alone I can just sit on the couch and I'm hungry I can eat whatever I want. It's not like "What should we eat for breakfast? Wait! We should coordinate!" That's a pain.@Jake the Dog

Prismo@Wait, dude! Look, I like you, so you should know my wishes always got an ironic twist to them. It's like a monkey's paw kind of thing.@Jake the Dog
Jake@What?@Jake the Dog
Prismo@You just gotta be really specific. Say your wish is "I wish for a back rub". Who's gonna give it to you? A dirty man? A bear? And where does this "masseuse" come from? Do I zap some guy away from his family dinner? Leave some kid traumatized?@Jake the Dog
Cosmic Owl@Woo!@Jake the Dog
Prismo@Mom, where did dad go? Oh, I don't know son he just disappeared from the table... sorry.@Jake the Dog
Prismo@You see, Jake there are rules to this stuff, wishing an event to be changes elements before and after it. Memories will be destroyed, babies will not be born. Potential worlds could be evaporated by your wish!@Jake the Dog

Cuber@So, did you guess the theme? Go ahead and pause your viewer now if you need a few more glayble to think about it a little. Oho! Now you’ve got it! I can tell! That’s right, the theme is the five tastes. You see, Jake ate a SWEET plum. Marceline played some SAVORY licks. Tree Trunks had a SOUR taste inside her mouth. Oh my. Gunter wanted to drink the SALTY tears. And Football's tea was BITTER. Huh? What’s that you say? You thought the theme was the five fingers? Don’t be silly! No one’s had five fingers for twenty blablillion glaybles. Five telepathy glands maybe. Ah… slimmin’. Well anyway, looks like it’s that time again.

Jake@Hey, Finn, you wanna have dinner instead of breakfast today? Finn? That must be him.@Davey
Candy Person #1@I MADE YOU DINNER, FINN! WHERE WERE YOU?!@Davey

Davey@You gotta start calling me Davey, mister. Because that's my name!@Davey
Davey@Daaaaaaaaaavvvveeeeeeyyyyyy!!!@Davey
Jake@Oh, no! Have you lost your teacups, man?@Davey
Davey@Mister, I don't know nothing about that. I'm just a working joe... trying to stake my claim... under the sun... and look out on the beautiful green fields called... life!@Davey
Jake@Uhhhhhhhh........@Davey
Randy@Hey, Davey, where do you want these logs?@Davey
Davey@Oh, just attach 'em to the cabin. Like how it should be. So it looks like a cabin. We're gonna build a right wall and front wall. Ummmmm-@Davey
Randy@How about the roof?@Davey
Davey@Maybe, maybe.@Davey
Randy@I've been holding these.@Davey
Davey@They look good.@Davey

BMO@Watch out! A robber!@Davey
Jake@I'll cut you! I mean, rob you!@Davey
Davey@Oh, no!@Davey
Jake@I'm a robber and I'm gonna rob this guy's life! And there's nobody who can stop me. Unless there's a hero around here. Like there's someone here who is actually a hero in disguise. They can probably stop me. C'mon, Finn. Be a hero.@Davey
Randy@What? What are we talking about?@Davey
Jake@Butt out, Randy!@Davey
Randy@Uhhhhhhhhhhhh.........@Davey
Jake@Yes, Finn. Put on your awesome hat and beat me up.@Davey
Randy@What?@Davey
Jake@I'm not talking to you, Randy!@Davey
Davey@I called the police.@Davey
Jake@Wait, what?@Davey
Jake@Guys, it's not what it looks like! That guy isn't really named Davey. It's Finn! He brainwashed himself to become Davey and I was just trying to inspire him to go back to being Finn.@Davey
Banana Guards@Yeah, yeah. We've heard that before. C'mon robber!@Davey
Jake@Finn, don't let the dragon drag on, man. Don't let the dragon drag on!@Davey
Davey@Don't let the dragon........ Jake!@Davey
Randy@Well that was pretty unusual, wasn't it, Davey?@Davey
Davey@Get outta here Randy! Geeeet ouuuuut!@Davey
Davey@No more Davey.@Davey
Mustache@But you love being Davey.@Davey
Finn@I do love being Davey, but being Davey caused Jake to get arrested.@Davey
Mustache@But remember that time when Davey sat in the park and saw some people walking around?@Davey
Finn@Yeah, that was nice.@Davey
Mustache@And remember that time when Davey swept the floors?@Davey
Finn@Yeah, that was great, too. But-@Davey
Mustache@Do you really wanna go back to being a famous hero? Why not just be Davey? A simple man... with simple goals and simple problems. You can just blend in and live the simple life.@Davey
Finn@Yeah.... Blend in. Y'know, maybe I'll be Davey just one more time!@Davey
Davey@One more time!@Davey
Banana Guard #1@C'mon, man! That last game wasn't fair.@Davey
Banana Guard #2@How about Who can hold up their hand the longest?@Davey
Banana Guard #1@Okay, this game breaks the tie.@Davey
Banana Guard #2@Okay.@Davey
Banana Guard #1@Last game.@Davey
Banana Guard #2@Last game.@Davey

Tree Trunks@Shelby. Shelby, wake up.@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@Where am I? Tree Trunks, what's going on?!@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@Uh, you've been snoozing on my dome. I just woke up in this room with these fellas Nectar, Ice Cream, and one of the Lemoncarbs.@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@Awake. Avast, hold tight your buns, if buns you do hold dear; for time has come to wake and run and not give way to fear!@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@What are those awful words?@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@I'm reading the wall. They are wall words.@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@Beyond this room are a thousand rooms, outside of them still more.@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@Behind each door, on every floor, danger, danger, ever more.@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@Stranger, hark! The traps galore may kill you whilst you do explore. To free yourself -@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Huh? Oh. Now where were we? To free yourself from this tomb, and nevermore re-enter, find the room amidst the rooms that lies exactly center?@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@It's a map!@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@I no longer need this map. I have infallible recall.@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@Oh! The room is trying to hug us! Oh no!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Oh, dag.@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@Check out my mods, bro.@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@Enough of this!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Huh? This room doesn't have any doors.@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@W- We're trapped!@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@This is wrong. The map lied to me-e. It doesn't want me to find the EXIT! Ice King, h-how do you taste?@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Uh, nice, I guess?@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@Mild or SPICY?!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Oh, uh - Kinda lonely.@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@Make yourself into food! Now!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@You're going to eat me? Yeah, right.@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@Slop your mouths up. I have found an oven and baking supplies.@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@I can make an apple pie for all of us.@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@Make them fast, servile.@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@If you want a taste of my juicy apple pie you better be nice. You got that?@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@I am sorry. Make pies, slave.@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@Okay, that's better, now let's see about this pie business.@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@All right, gentlemen. Have a look at my luscious, gooey apple pie.@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@No! Acceptable.@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@Uh, Lemongrab?@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@WHAT?!@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@Never mind.@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Come on, you guys. That mouse showed us the room door.@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Say, you know what's weird?@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@What, Papi?@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Well, isn't it weird how Tree Trunks' ability to make pies is specifically what helped us escape from that room?@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@I make pies, too, Papi.@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Right, yeah, like, battery pies or summin'?@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@No. Real pies. Don't you remember? I am your s-@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Hey! Look, another room!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Good grief, it's humid in here.@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@That door will lead us closer to the exit!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Hold up, hold up! Look!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@There has to be a way to get across without that thing chompin' our WOO-HOOS!@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@Can't you fly us across, Papi?@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Oh yeah, I can sure try.@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Nggh! Aw dang, this heat is negating my powers! Can't do nothin' with this steam coming off the water.@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@NGH, glob! Fah! Nagh! Look at this! Well, that's it. Show's over. I'll just die here and y'all can eat my body if you want to survive.@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@Golly, how we ever gonna worm our way out of this... fishy situation?@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@I think I have an idea.@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@That's a girl, Tree Trunks! You can do it!@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@This is gonna work out just fine.@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@Oh, that's warm on my undercarriage.@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@H-help me guys!@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@Yes, Papi!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@NNGH! Lemongrab, c'mon!@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@Bleh! Wow, that was heavy, man.@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@Aw yeah, I've been reborn!@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@Look!@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@Let's go then!@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@Papi, no! Ouchies!@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@Look out, Shelby!@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@WOOAH! WUOAGH!@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@OUGHF! MY JUICE!! MY VITAL JUICES!!!@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@MOMMY!!!@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@The hidden door! Hohuugh..@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@My vital essence depleted... Must.. replenish...@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@Oh, step back, you all.@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@Ugh!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Ew.@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@Nugh.. That'll do, Slave Trunks. To the spiraling ledge!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@We almost there, Lemongrab?@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@Yes.@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@Faster, TT!@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@Don't criticize my running, Shelby.@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@This door leads to the center exit!@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@The door is secured with an esoteric encryption system.@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Well that's okay, 'cause you can hack the mainframe or whatever, right BMO?@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@I'm not BMO, I'm your son Neptr. I-I throw pies.@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Ohhhs! I grabbed the wrong robot! Dang! Nuts face!@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@Uhhh ... what is going on here Ice King?@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@Yes, I'm getting a weird feeling in my stomach, and I think it's 'cause of you, Mr. Wizard you'd better fess up to whatever you're doing. I got no time for nobody dancing around and acting fool at my expense. I'm Tree Trunks and people know I'm kind and honest, that's why people like me.@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Huh? Wha-wha-what's she sayin'?@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@So stop sellin' fib-bibs and give it straight!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Grrrr! All right! I knocked you all out and brought you here!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@I'm sorry, but I had to do it. Each of you possess the exact qualities to pass the various tests of this dungeon Tree Trunks with your baking skills; Lemongrab with your lemony-juicy...@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@Essence.@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Yeah... Shelby, who should've been the bait for the fish.@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@Yeah..but no, thanks.@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@And..BMO, who should've been here instead of this weird piece of junk that I don't remember nothin' about. Ahhh, I failed!@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@Father! Look at me.@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@Are you happy with me now, Papi?@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Yes! Yes! Oh, my son! The grand prize of my loins!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Now you see why I needed to bring you all here. Behold! The Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving!@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@What's it do?@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Whatever goes in the Magi's flames..comes to life, anything at all!@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@Uh, like an ashtray?@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Yes! Isn't it amazing?!@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@Uh..You should've told us! I would've freaking brought something!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Do not be sad. Because I brought the ultimate thing! This.@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@Your journal?@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Except..it's not my journal! It's my Fionna & Cake fan-fiction! All my brilliant fantasies will now be real. Fionna, Cake, Marshall Lee; they'll all be living, breathing beings, just like me.@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@You serve no function, you must be destroyed!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Yes! Yes!@Mystery Dungeon
Book@Woo, hahaha, yeah!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@No..NO! Another cruel joke on my life!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Oh, good..you're awake, you bum. Look what you did.. Get out of my Face! Yeah, yeah Get out!@Mystery Dungeon
Finn@This is the spot? Right here? What was that?!@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@C'mon Ice Cream. We-we're leavin'@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@OK.@Mystery Dungeon
Jake@I'm tellin' you dude, my pie-dar's goin' 'nay-nays.@Mystery Dungeon
Jake@Oww!@Mystery Dungeon
Book@Write in me!@Mystery Dungeon
Finn@What the—This is very strange.@Mystery Dungeon
Jake@TT! Where is the pie at?!@Mystery Dungeon
Tree Trunks@Oh, Mister Lemoncarb ate it.@Mystery Dungeon
Lemongrab@Bye, don't follow me.@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@Hey, Jake can I catch you a ride back home?@Mystery Dungeon
Jake@Yeah, but what the heck is goin' on here?@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@Ice King was doin' some... desperate business, but it didn't work out. He seems pretty bummed out 'bout it.@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@Don't be sad, Papi. Your characters can always be real in the garden of your mind.@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@They can?@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@Remember when you showed me your imagination zone?@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Yes! Yes, if I can concentrate...@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@It worked!@Mystery Dungeon
Fionna@I missed you, Ice King!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Oh, Fionna, can dreams be real as waking life?@Mystery Dungeon
Fionna@Of course they can! Dreams are real!@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@Then I will wait for you, from across the threshold of consciousness.@Mystery Dungeon
Neptr@Our worlds will surely meet, Ice King.@Mystery Dungeon
Ice King@I, too, feel this; and it feels so strong it must be true.@Mystery Dungeon
Finn@Who in this world is sadder than the Ice King?@Mystery Dungeon
Shelby@Me, watching this.@Mystery Dungeon
Book@Yeah! Write it down! Write it down!@Mystery Dungeon
Princess Bubblegum@What the... "mmmmn Princess Bubblegum, we are starving, immediately send us all of your candy. How dare you, ours, Lemon Grabs." Bull gunk! I left them a lifetime supply of candy!@All Your Fault
Princess Bubblegum@Hey Finn! Hey Jake! Can you come up here? I have a job for you!@All Your Fault
Finn@Okay!@All Your Fault
Jake@Sorry CB, we'll finish this up later.@All Your Fault
Finn@Hey, Preebs.@All Your Fault
Princess Bubblegum@Hey, guys. I got a letter from the earls of Lemongrab. They've gone through all the food that I've sent them. This case contains precious candy seeds for the Lemongrabs to grow new food. So, I need you two to deliver these seeds to Lemon Castle.@All Your Fault
Finn@For sure. We'll do it.@All Your Fault
Princess Bubblegum@Good luck, gentlemen!@All Your Fault
Cinnamon Bun@Bye, girlfriend!@All Your Fault
Jake@Hey, Lemongrabs! You home?@All Your Fault
Finn@Holy--!@All Your Fault
Finn@Jake? Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!@All Your Fault
Jake@Kiss it!@All Your Fault
Finn@Aah! Sorry, dudes--got no food! No... food! Hey!@All Your Fault
Jake@Hey! Weirdos! Get the birthday cake!@All Your Fault
Lemonjon@Are you lemon?@All Your Fault
Finn and Jake@Whoa!@All Your Fault
Jake@What the thing is up with this guy?@All Your Fault
Lemonjon@Does your head come to a nub?@All Your Fault
Jake@What?@All Your Fault
Lemonjon@You are un-lemon.@All Your Fault
Finn@Yeah. Cool, man. Hey, do you know where--?@All Your Fault
Lemonjon@I am Lemonjon. I see you made it past our Lemon mmmmmmmeringerie!@All Your Fault
Finn@Wait, what?@All Your Fault
Lemonjon@They're quite hungry.@All Your Fault
Finn@Yeah. What the heck's going on here?@All Your Fault
Lemonjon@There is no food, only Lemons--Lemons with bellies empty but for lemon lusts!@All Your Fault
Finn@Whatever, Lemonjon. We've gotta give those dumb-butts these seeds.@All Your Fault
Jake@Where should we go?@All Your Fault
Lemonjon@Mmmmmmmy senses tell me that they're in the dungeon. They've been there for three weeks. Three weeks, dungeon.@All Your Fault
Jake@I wonder who put them in there.@All Your Fault
Finn@I don't know, but we gotta bust them out! Which way to the dungeon, Lemonjon?@All Your Fault
Jake@Oh, cool!@All Your Fault
Finn@Thanks, man!@All Your Fault
Jake@Yeah, thanks, man!@All Your Fault
Jake@Hmmm.@All Your Fault
Jake@Hmmm.@All Your Fault
Finn@Yo, Lemon-wipes!@All Your Fault
Jake@Yech.@All Your Fault
Jake@Um, maybe we should hands... for safety.@All Your Fault
Finn@Yeah, sure!@All Your Fault
Jake@So, where'd you want to look ne-- Eeeh! Uh, Finn?!@All Your Fault
Finn@Oh, sorry dude.@All Your Fault
Finn@Stay close to me.@All Your Fault
Jake@Nope!@All Your Fault
Jake@I think this is it.@All Your Fault
Finn@All locked up! There they are! Hey, Lemongrabs, we're here! We're gonna get you out, just hold tight!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@Go away.@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@No food here.@All Your Fault
Jake@Maybe the kidnapper's in there, too, coercing them.@All Your Fault
Finn@Probably the grossest one of all, too--beet red skin, barf, poopin' all its junk-sculpture.@All Your Fault
Jake@Ah, stop, man! You're just makin' it worse! Let's just get this over with.@All Your Fault
Finn@Lemongrabs, you're free!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@They broke the door! The door is broken now!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@FIX THE DOOR!@All Your Fault
Jake@Fix the door? What?! What? Fix the door? Fix--what? What's goin' on here? Fix the door. Finn, what's goin' on? Fix the door.@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@It doesn't matter anymore.@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@There is no more candy to hoard. Let them keep what crumbs they find, for there are no crumbs.@All Your Fault
Lemongrabs@NO CRUMBS!@All Your Fault
Finn@Are you saying you locked yourselves down here with all the food so you could eat it yourselves?@All Your Fault
Jake@You know there's guys starvin' up there?!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@Hmm. No, no. You do not understand. It is not us for whom they starve, but them...@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@...for whom they starve.@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@Mm! Yes, yes! For the candy food was not consumed--no, no--but was given life!@All Your Fault
Finn@Wha--?@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@You see, Finn, when Mother Princess last visited Lemongrab...@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@...when she saw fit to create me, Lemongrab...@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@...she left behind a little something-something the secret formula for creating candy life! She must have meant for us to have it, to keep making more family.@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@Yes, yes! All her fault!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@What? What'd you say?@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@I said, "all her fault."@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@Oh, indeed! For once we had commenced, how could we desist?@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@I looked deep in myself and found that I'm a guy who can't stop making candy life from the food he needs.@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@Me, too.@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@It just felt so pretty okay inside, greeting each new placid face...@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@...and hearing each new piercing song!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@We used the last of the food to make Plop-Top, here.@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@Mm. I thought we said Dump-Dome.@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@Who cares anyway? They've brought no food! We're all going to die!@All Your Fault
Finn@Look. We brought these seeds. They're special candy seeds.@All Your Fault
Jake@You can grow new food now.@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@Oh, yes. Hmm, mm-hmm, mmhm. Yes.@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@Yes, yes. There we go!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@Ha-haaa! We'll call you Seed-Wad!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@Ooh!@All Your Fault
Jake@You really are gonna die.@All Your Fault
Finn@...and all your boys, too!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@Our... boys?@All Your Fault
Finn@Come on. We'll take you to see Princess Bubblegum. She knows more about candy than anyone; she built a whole kingdom out of candy!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@Yes. Okay.@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@For our boys.@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@But first we will notify the children of our impending departure...@All Your Fault
Lemongrabs@...so they won't worry about us while we're away.@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@Okay, yes. The hard times are over!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@Mmmm, here's the plan...@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@We will go to the Candy Kingdom and take all their candy from them! Then we will give that candy precious life and build a candy army so we may then go forth and pillage candy for all to eat!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@Now go, young Lemonjon!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@Go! Go!@All Your Fault
Finn@What's going on, Lemongrabs?!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@It's all your fault!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@All your fault!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab@We warned you!@All Your Fault
Lemongrab 2@We warned you about us!@All Your Fault
Finn@Yaaaah! What the--?@All Your Fault
Finn and Jake@Whoaaaaaa!@All Your Fault
Finn@Jake! Are you alright?@All Your Fault
Jake@Yeah, but look! He's heading right for the Candy Kingdom!@All Your Fault
Finn@And he's too big to duke it out with! Unless...@All Your Fault
Jake@Giant poison candy aspirin! I've got this one, but it might be too small.@All Your Fault
Finn@No. We'll kick him in his heart 'til he's history. Those must have been Lemonjon's guts we saw before. His heart is his weak spot.@All Your Fault
Jake@Yeah, but we'll never find it again in time... unless that's it there with the juice coming out. Remember all that juice, from before?@All Your Fault
Finn@Oh yeah, that's probably it. Whoaaa! Oh, man!@All Your Fault
Jake@Tastes like vitamins.@All Your Fault
Jake@Are you sure this is it? It's not even doing anything.@All Your Fault
Finn@Just smash it already, grandma.@All Your Fault
Jake@Right.@All Your Fault
Finn@Oh, nice one, Jake.@All Your Fault
Lemonjon@Whoa, hold the phone! What is this powerful new juice coursing fromst my core source? The juice aches. Is this the rumored ache of feeling? The feeling of caring unknown to Lemons? New thoughts emerge! If I act, the Candy People will suffer. If I don't, the Lemon people will suffer. The greater good demands but one course only that I dissolve the bonds uniting me and become component to all!@All Your Fault
Finn@Whoa, dang! That Lemonjon turned himself all up into lemon candy! Man, that Lemonjon's all right.@All Your Fault
Princess Bubblegum@...and... there... we... go. All done! The last trace of the candy life formula is out of their heads!@All Your Fault
Finn@...and I snatched this out of the Lemon castle, boyee!@All Your Fault
Princess Bubblegum@Now we all just have to keep a closer eye on those two so they don't get in to any more trouble.@All Your Fault
Jake@But how come we don't just fix their hearts like we did with Lemonjon so they're more selfless and less selfish?@All Your Fault
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, no, no. Their hearts are fine. They're just like this.@All Your Fault
Lemongrabs@Hmm!@All Your Fault
Finn & Jake@Woo! woo! woo!@Little Dude
Jake@I think the swimming hole's right around the corner!@Little Dude
Finn@Yes! Woo! Woo!@Little Dude
Jake@First one in the water is...um...first one in the water!@Little Dude

Jake@Yeah.@Little Dude
Finn@Well, don't abuse it man. 'Cause you're gettin'...@Little Dude

Finn@Yeah, but it's like, living now.@Little Dude
Jake@Yeah, it's a miracle. Now he can listen to our rad jokes and hang out.@Little Dude
Finn@Right. Maybe it's good he's alive. You were a rad hat, and now you're a rad...little dude.@Little Dude
Finn@Yo, bro! Our eyes are down here. C'mon little dude. Let's go live life!@Little Dude
Finn & Jake@Yeah! Woo hoo!@Little Dude

BMO@I am fine, Finn. I just thought you kept better company.@Little Dude
Finn@Sorry, BMO, he's just excited.@Little Dude
Finn@Sorry, Little Dude, but I have to eat.@Little Dude
BMO@Don't touch anything! I'm still frying up garnish!@Little Dude
Finn@Okay.@Little Dude
Jake@Yeah, okay.@Little Dude
Jake@Your head looks weird with short hair man, heh, heh, it feels like a peach.@Little Dude
Finn@Hey, Little Dude, y'all can get in on this if you promise to be good. Only good babies get sassages.@Little Dude
Little Dude@Nyang!@Little Dude
Jake@Hey, don't eat the—the food?@Little Dude
Finn@Dude, he turned it into poo! This is poo now—smell it!@Little Dude
Jake@Yep.@Little Dude
Finn & Jake@Little Dude!@Little Dude
Jake@Quit it! Gotcha!@Little Dude
Finn@Oh, little Deezy. What am I gonna do with you?@Little Dude
BMO@You guys should get ready for bed.@Little Dude

Little Dude@Nyang! Nyang!@Little Dude
Finn@Shhhh. Little Dude, you gotta chill. Night-night.@Little Dude
Little Dude@Nyang. Nyang. Nyang.@Little Dude
Little Dude@Nyang.@Little Dude
Finn@Jake, wake up. Someone's on the house!@Little Dude
Jake@Tsk, it's probably Ice King again, dude. Man, we should tell him we know he sleeps on the top of our house. Oh.@Little Dude

Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving@Please don't hurt me! You're in grave danger and it's all my fault!@Little Dude
Finn@Wha? What are you talking about?@Little Dude
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving@Your hat accidentally touched my head flower. See? My magic imbues anything it touches with an evil spirit, one that craves destruction and chaos. Yech. I buried myself so that nothing would touch my body ever again, but then this bloom grew out of my head. C'est la vie!@Little Dude
Finn@Evil magic donks, homey.@Little Dude
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving@I'm sorry, that's just the way my magic works. Papa always said I was a bad wizard. Right, Papa?! "Baby's a bad wizard." A bad wizard, huh?! You're a bad wizard! I'm a bad wizard! @Little Dude

Fionna@♫ Bad little boy. ♫@Bad Little Boy
Fionna@♫ That's what you're acting like, I really don't buy... that you're that kind of guy... and if you are, why do you want to hang out with me? ♫@Bad Little Boy
Marshall Lee@♫ Don't you know I'm a villain? Every night I'm out killin', sending everyone runnin' like children. I know why you're mad at me. I've got demon eyes, and they're looking right through your anatomy... into your deepest fears. Baby, I'm not from here. I'm from the Nightosphere... To me, you're clear. Transparent. You got a thing for me, girl; it's apparent. ♫@Bad Little Boy

Finn@Yeah, I heard.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Ugh, he's so annoying.@Vault of Bones
Jake@Well, I was just trying to help.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Oh, not you, Jake, my dad. I always catch him whispering stuff in my ear while I'm not paying attention. He keeps saying I'm evil.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Whoa, you best not be believing that whack bunk. I bet he's trying to make your life bad, so you'll think you're evil. But you're really not!@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@How can I know for sure?@Vault of Bones
Finn@Dungeons.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@What?@Vault of Bones
Finn@Let's have a good time in a dungeon or something, that always clears my head that reminds me what's what.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@And that will make me good?@Vault of Bones
Finn@No, that will show you not to worry so much, because you're already good in here.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Ok, yeah, let's do it.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Dungeons!@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Dungeons!@Vault of Bones
Jake@Camomile tea!@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Is this how you look for a dungeon?@Vault of Bones
Finn@Yeah... a lot of times the entrances are hidden, so you gotta look under rocks and stuff for a secret switch.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Sometimes it takes a while... Hmm.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@I'll just use my heat sense.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@That tree over there is not made of wood.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Really?@Vault of Bones
Finn@Yes!@Vault of Bones
Finn@Ooh... gauntlet.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Thanks for taking me out Finn.@Vault of Bones
Finn@No prob, Bob, light this for me, will ya?@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Oh, sure. Um... do we need a torch? I'm sort of made of fire.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Oh...well, I guess torches are just cool for dungeons, you know?@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Oh, okay.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Yeah...I like to hang on to it.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Boy, this place is creepy!@Vault of Bones
Finn@Really? I feel like it's trying too hard. Gold piece!@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Oh, you mean, like, with all the skulls?@Vault of Bones
Finn@Whoa! Whoa!@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@What?@Vault of Bones
Boney@Hey! What are you doing here?@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Burning you alive!@Vault of Bones
Finn@Haha no, no, wait a sec. Sorry, one second.@Vault of Bones
Boney@Sure.@Vault of Bones
Finn@He might have an important loot on him, so we don't wanna just burn him up; plus it's a little cruel even for an evil guy, check this out. RRRAAA, you're gonna surrender!@Vault of Bones
Boney@Okay, okay, I surrender!!!@Vault of Bones
Finn@I shall grant thee clemency! If you do the splits! Do the splits!@Vault of Bones
Boney@I-I can't-I can't do the splits.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Do the splits, thou milk-livered maggot pie!@Vault of Bones
Boney@Okay, okay...Ow, ow, ow!@Vault of Bones
Finn@See, a lot of times you can overpower these guys with confidence.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Neat!@Vault of Bones
Finn@Got any loot on ya?@Vault of Bones
Boney@Just this map. It'll-it'll help you.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Ha! See? This would've been burned!@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Yeah, no, that makes sense.@Vault of Bones
Finn@What else you got?!@Vault of Bones
Boney@Yeah! Uh, uh, there's a treasure chest in the corner, please stop yelling.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Hah, hah! I knew it. Oh, cram it to the butternuts, it's locked!@Vault of Bones
Boney@Aahh! I don't know were the keys is, please don't yell!@Vault of Bones
Finn@Hahaha, alright. We can come back to that later. Hey, are you having fun?@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Mhm.@Vault of Bones
Boney@I- I'll just stay here.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Race you to the next monster!@Vault of Bones
Finn@WHOA, whoa!@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@What?@Vault of Bones
Finn@That's not how you do things in a dungeon. You gotta sneak.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Sneak?@Vault of Bones
Finn@Like this. And you gotta look around.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Ok, this guy's too big to intimidate, but I have a plan. First, you shoot some fire at that rope, the chandelier falls, we distract the monster and we run in. Element surprise.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Wow.@Vault of Bones
Finn@You ready?@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Yeah.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Before we go in, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire?@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Uhh... what?@Vault of Bones
Finn@Like on a scale of 1 to 100, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire at a rope 50 feet away?@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Uhh...@Vault of Bones
Finn@Scale of 1 to 100.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@42.@Vault of Bones
Finn@42?!@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Well, I don't know! I've never rated myself before.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Well, that's cool, that's cool. Just try to hit that rope.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Are you okay?@Vault of Bones
Finn@Yeah, I'm good. it's a hologram.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Oh. Neat. So, uhh, should we keep going?@Vault of Bones
Finn@Yeah, although it does raise the question. Why would someone go through the trouble of setting up a hologram? Unless... they've hidden something in this room?@Vault of Bones
Finn@Hey, wake up.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@I was meditating.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Look what I found.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@A key!@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@We have to go back?@Vault of Bones
Finn@We don't have to, we get to! Come on.@Vault of Bones
Finn@See? That didn't take long at all. Now we get treasure.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Okay.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Nope. This key's for something else. Haha. Oh, well.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Jeez. This is kinda boring. At least he's walking fast.@Vault of Bones
Finn@See? That's where I found the key.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Snapdragons!!@Vault of Bones
Snapdragon@Take my place, take my place! Take my-@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Scatter fire!@Vault of Bones
Finn@No, no, we shake them down first, remember?@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@He... wanted me to take his place.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Man. Ooh, hold on. Ha ha! It's another key! Now we get to go back to the beginning! Whoohoo!@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Finn, I'm not having any fun.@Vault of Bones
Finn@What? Why?@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Well, you keep wanting me to do things your way. But I don't like doing things your way. Is that because I am evil?@Vault of Bones
Finn@What? No, wait, that's... no! Uhh, hey, you know what? Let's do things your way.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Really?@Vault of Bones
Finn@Yeah. I've been acting an uncouth lout, m'lady. Okay, so there's a door over there. What do you wanna do?@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@I... burn it down.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Okay, that worked. Now what do you do...@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@RRAAAAAGGGHHH!!@Vault of Bones
Finn@Uhh... Good- good job, FP.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Thanks, FTH! Haa! Ughh, doors! Burn, burn, burn! Huh? Ugh.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Oh, Sham man. It's the legion of Goo Skulls! Uh, how do you defend?@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Uhh... snake fire!!@Vault of Bones
Finn@Fire burn goo.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Yes! Feel my flames, puny worms! The power of destruction!@Vault of Bones
Finn@Woh. Whoa! Flame Princess!!@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Huh?@Vault of Bones
Finn@Ahh!!!@Vault of Bones
Finn@Help me! But don't use fire because you'll- mphh!@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Release him or feel the wrath of the Princess of Flames!@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Very well.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Do the splits! Do the splits, thou milk-livered maggot pie!@Vault of Bones
Finn@Hot Daniel! Flame Princess. I thought you were going to burn me alive.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@No way! I'd never do that to my boyfriend.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@Ha, thanks Finn. That was a really awesome experience.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Dungeons totes clear your head, right?@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@I forget how good it feels to destroy stuff.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Uhhhh.....@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@I mean, like evil stuff.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Oh yeah, cool.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@We should go again sometimes. Do you know any other dungeons?@Vault of Bones
Finn@Maybe next time we should just go to like... a farmer's market.@Vault of Bones
Flame Princess@And burn it.@Vault of Bones
Finn@Hmm, try this key.@Vault of Bones
Finn@What is it?@Vault of Bones
Finn@Finn to Prubs, come in, Prubs.@The Great Bird Man
Princess Bubblegum@Hey, Finn! How's the mission going?@The Great Bird Man
Finn@So far, no sign of the Bird Man. Why's this guy so dangerous?@The Great Bird Man
Princess Bubblegum@Some say he's a half-man, half-bird that poops fire while he flies. It's all rumors so far. That's why I need you and Jake to find out everything you can about him and report back to me.@The Great Bird Man
Finn@Where are you?@The Great Bird Man
Princess Bubblegum@Under the sea. The mermaids are trying to beach themselves. I came to see why. Turns out they're just lonely.@The Great Bird Man
Finn@Maybe I'll go hang out with them after this biz.@The Great Bird Man
Princess Bubblegum@Sounds great, Finn.@The Great Bird Man
Finn@Okay. Bye, PB.@The Great Bird Man
Princess Bubblegum@Bye!@The Great Bird Man
Jake@C'mon, let's go look for that creep!@The Great Bird Man
Finn@Whoa.@The Great Bird Man
Finn@Huh? Where am I?@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@This is the rookery, where I and my bird friends dwell!@The Great Bird Man
Finn@So are you, like, the Great Bird Man?@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@That's what they call me nowadays. But when I first met you, Finn, and you, Jake, you knew me as Xergiok, the Goblin King!@The Great Bird Man
Finn and Jake@Whaaa—?!@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@When we first met, I was crazy for smacking goblin hams. I was cruel, selfish, brutal. But every thing changed after I was defeated by the two of you!@The Great Bird Man
Jake@So, you got some sleek new shades, and now everything's different?@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@Oh, no, my change has been deep. And these whatsits are only curtains for empty windows.@The Great Bird Man
Finn@Whoa. What happened there?@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@I miffed off a wizard, and he took my eyes. I wonder what he wanted them for—some kind of lotion... or potion... or time-traveling spell. I'll never know. Never, ever, never. But losing my eyesight was only the beginning of my wonderful change! I started meditating and doing yoga. Now I can "see" with my heart and smell with my soul.@The Great Bird Man
Jake@You smell with your beard?@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@I smell with my nose!@The Great Bird Man
Jake@Lame.@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@Om.@The Great Bird Man
Finn@What are you doing?@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@Oh, Taffy! You heard my call! Climb aboard, boys. Taffy will take us to the lower level, and you can have a bite to eat!@The Great Bird Man

Xergiok@There you go, little ones. Suckle, suckle!@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@They're small, but they sure can take a lot out of you. Whoo! Dizzy. Sometimes feeding really wipes me out. I hope you'll excuse me while I refocus my qi. See you in a while!@The Great Bird Man
Finn@Now's our chance to do some snooping.@The Great Bird Man
Finn@Jake! I found his weapon stash!@The Great Bird Man

Jake@Shush, child!@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@Ah, Finn and Jake, you are here!@The Great Bird Man
Finn@Where'd you learn that heal spell?@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@I use no magic. I manipulated space with a vibrational chant. You see, now the injury has transferred to me! Ooh, yeah, that hurts, baby! Whoo! Can't you see, Jake? I love these birds more than I love myself. What am I to the deafening roar of the macro-cosmos? Nothing much. Just a vessel to carry the message of friendship to y'all beasts and dirt!@The Great Bird Man
Finn@Dirt?@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@Yeah, look! Hello, friends! Go for a ride!@The Great Bird Man

Xergiok@Alright. Oh, where are they?@The Great Bird Man
Finn@Dude, your eyes are in your beard.@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@A-ha, what? Good job, guys. Goofin' on the blind guy—real nice!@The Great Bird Man
Finn@No, man, they're right here.@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@What my life?!@The Great Bird Man

Xergiok@And these aren't grapes, right?@The Great Bird Man
Finn@No, man.@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@Hmm. Finn and Jake, could you help me onto Cardamom's back? I would like to be high in the clouds, bathed in the pinks and the blues of the desert twilight, when I restore my sight.@The Great Bird Man
Jake@Sure, okay.@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@Climb aboard! Vanilla! Chocolat! Cinnamon! Agave! All my friends, to the sky! Far, far above, Time standing still, Memories are One, Same space, same will.

Finn@How's it feel, man?@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@Oh, yeah, it's overwhelming. This view takes me back. I always loved the sunset. And the silhouettes of my little goblins lined up to receive their spankings! Well, the past is the past. I wanna thank you guys for finding my eyes. I don't know where I got that idea about the wizard!@The Great Bird Man
Jake@You were in the desert a long time, man.@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@Yes, twenty years.@The Great Bird Man
Jake@Nah, it was more like one year and change, dude.@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@Yes, things certainly have changed for me in that time. Say, who's ruling the uh, Goblin Kingdom since I left?@The Great Bird Man

Xergiok@Oh, Whisper Dan! That's cool. Cool, cool. Hey, you guys wanna ride back to your crib?@The Great Bird Man
Finn@Yeah, sure, man.@The Great Bird Man
Jake@Uh, wait. Xergiok, this is the Goblin Kingdom.@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@I know, but I was thinking—now that I'm wiser, I could rule as king again!@The Great Bird Man
Finn@That idea is terrible.@The Great Bird Man
Xergiok@Well, you know, I disagree! And I have my army of bird friends, so anyone who disagrees with me should get a SPANKING!@The Great Bird Man
Goblin Guard 1@Hey, Jeff, is that your real laugh?@The Great Bird Man

Jake@That's it?! A joke?@Puhoy
BMO@Maybe she just didn't get it yet.@Puhoy
Finn@Yeah right, BMO. More like she used up all her laughs on some other guy's jokes probably. Man, having a girlfriend is hard.@Puhoy
Jake@No! Being crazy is hard. You're getting all hung up, all hung up on imaginary problems. You gotta focus on what's real, man. You see this cup? This is literally my favorite cup. Now it's gone forever. So it's not real, and I don't care about it anymore.@Puhoy
BMO@Oh no! My favorite window!@Puhoy
Finn@I don't even know what you guys are talking about. I think I just need some alone time. Gotta let my mind fester a bit, you know? I'll be back in a little while.@Puhoy

Finn@Eh, yeah, i-it's really cool. Where I come from, I live with my best friend, who's my brother. And he's a dog. We fight stuff; it's cool. It's really different than here. I mean, where I'm from, blankets and pillows are used for bedding.@Puhoy

Quilton@Archaeologists found this in the Pillow Catacombs The Pillownomicon.@Puhoy
Finn@Oh my glob.@Puhoy

Rasheeta@Yes, you must be Finn the Human Man, seeker of the wandering portal.@Puhoy
Finn@Yes, I've searched for decades--how did you know?@Puhoy
Rasheeta@I've read it in the Tea Leaves, this newspaper I found from the future.@Puhoy
Finn@Does it say how I get home?@Puhoy
Rasheeta@The real question is are you sure you want to?@Puhoy
Finn@Uh... yeah!@Puhoy
Rasheeta@Well don't worry, you won't be here long.@Puhoy
Finn@So there is another way to... Oof...@Puhoy
Rasheeta@Not long now.@Puhoy
Finn@Oh...@Puhoy
Bonnie@Father?@Puhoy
Jay@What did the oracle say, father? Have we come to the right spot finally?@Puhoy

Roselinen@Oh, Finn. I know you have to go, all these years I've known, but now that it's time... Oh man, I'm just all messed up about it. Just promise me you'll remember us, when you're back in your real life.@Puhoy
Finn@Hmm, that reminds me, Roselinen, of something Jake told me just before I came to this world.@Puhoy
Jake@You're getting all hung up on imaginary problems, stay with your new wife. You've known her longer now than any of us. You're not even sure if I ever really existed. And I'm pretty sure I didn't look like this.@Puhoy
Finn@Man. How did he see it all coming so clearly? Come on, everyone. Pack your things, we're going home.@Puhoy
BMO@Ha ha he, ha ha he, goodness, Jake, why don't you do this with your other babies?@Puhoy

Braco@Princess, I love you! I-I love you so much it hurts. The pain it—Huh?.@The Suitor

Finn@Oh, cool. That's cool—you're dating, that's coool. See ya, Princess.@The Suitor
Finn@What'd ya think of that Braco guy? I mean, he seems kinda weird and passive and baby lambish and too unheroic for Peebs. And then I smashed that peach!@The Suitor
Braco@Jake and Finn, I seek your aid. I need to ask you for that map, therewith I can bring the soul stone to Bubblegum. Then she'll love me!@The Suitor

Princess Bubblegum@Braco. Ehhh, what happened to you?@The Suitor
Braco@Oh, look, can it be? It's a soul stone!@The Suitor
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, yeah, sorry, but I don't need that anymore. I just finished programming a proper simulation of a soul. In fact, this is much easier to manipulate than a real one. Braco?@The Suitor
Braco@Hmmm, WHY WON'T SHE LOVE ME?! Ahhh!@The Suitor
Ogdoad@Set me free, you tranch!@The Suitor
Peppermint Butler@Give me the key to the shadow realm!@The Suitor

Princess Bubblegum@Oh, Braco, I don't want any of that mess. I do love you, but it's the undifferentiated love I feel for all candy citizens. I couldn't permit one of my citizens to suffer the way I saw you suffering over me. And so I made you this. Meet my doppelganger, P-Bot.@The Suitor
Braco@Uhhh, this feels super-wrong.@The Suitor
Princess Bubblegum Bot@Oh, Braco, let's get out of this smelly lab.@The Suitor
Braco@Okay! Thank you, Princess! Woohoo!@The Suitor
Princess Bubblegum Bot@Woohoo!@The Suitor
Princess Bubblegum@You're welcome, my love .@The Suitor

Cuber@Oh, hello. Here for more graybles, I presume. Well you've come to the right computer-fable. Feast your eyes-mabel, on my holo-pyramid viewer and— Huh? What's that? Not in the mood for graybles, you say? Oh dear. You okay? Did something fatlabel happen to you? Oh, I see. You'd rather watch me buh-blabel a bird-house in my workshop. Hm. More of a grayble man by trade. But okay! Come on!@Another Five More Short Graybles
Cuber@Oh, hello again! As you can see, the bird-house is nearly complete! All that's left is where the door hole goes. But I can't remember. Hm. Door hole. Wait! I just remembered! My door hole solution lies in one of tonight's scheduled graybles! Would you mind I look through them to find it? OK! Yeey! Here we go!@Another Five More Short Graybles

Jake Jr.@What?@Another Five More Short Graybles
Jake@You know, "in the dumps."@Another Five More Short Graybles
Jake Jr.@Oh, sorry. It's cool. I'm just thinking about the future, I guess. We're on, like, the bleeding edge of history. Everything ahead of us is totally unknown and there's no guarantee that things are going to be all right. It's exciting, but it's also pretty scary. You know?@Another Five More Short Graybles
Jake@Sounds like my little baby girl wanna build a time machine!@Another Five More Short Graybles
Finn@Ooooh!@Another Five More Short Graybles
Jake Jr.@Guys, I don't—@Another Five More Short Graybles

I heard that this show is really good for penguins. Wow, that's really lucky for you guys, I'm a little jealous. Well anyway, good luck to all our nominees! OK, all in favor of "Blimby's "WHO GOTS DA ABC'S"—raise your hands.@Another Five More Short Graybles
Ice King@OK, all in favor of "Baby Ballet"—raise your hands.@Another Five More Short Graybles
Ice King@OK, all in favor of Air—What!? "Baby Ballet"? Come on! Ugh! I should have never given you penguins the right to vote. Well, you may have numbers on your side, but I still have one trick up my sleeve. Bargaining. Whereby, you let me watch "Basic Mortality," and I in return will do anything you want in the whole world. How 'bout it?@Another Five More Short Graybles
Middle Penguin@Wenk.@Another Five More Short Graybles
Ice King@Algebraic!@Another Five More Short Graybles
Man@I know he was your partner.@Another Five More Short Graybles
Woman@Enough! Alan is not the super-murderer!@Another Five More Short Graybles

Lemongrab 2@The end! My end!@Another Five More Short Graybles
Mr. Fox@My end... table, my love seat, yeah. Gee but it's great to be back home. It's always a blast visiting my cousin, city-Fox, at his future palace, but you just can't beat that old country steez. City-Fox's digs be mad sterile. Look a this. This was my grandpa's rug. Some bums let him have it 'cause it was so ugly. And check out these classic stylings. They don't make 'em like this anymore! Wow! Haha! Almost got me right in my both eyes! Look at my bugs. Man, I always did have the ugliest bugs. What are they doing? Selling each other houses?@Another Five More Short Graybles
Mr. Fox@Yes, siree, there's some things money can't buy. You see that depression? You can't buy that, you gotta earn it. Boy, it's like I can almost see myself sleeping in there. Wha—? "Dear conscious self, I know where some buried treasure is. I'll draw you a map. Love, subconscious self." Oh my gosh, I'm gonna be rich! @Another Five More Short Graybles
Mr Fox@What the—? Oh, no! My riches!@Another Five More Short Graybles

Sub-conscious Mr. Fox@M-m-m-m, what a jerk.@Another Five More Short Graybles

Cuber@Ha-ha! There it is! You see? The birdhouse door—it's right above the peg thingy. Why didn't I think of that? Well, I guess that's it for this week. I'll see you crimpy glimmers on the—what? What's that? You want to finish the grayble? You want to see if you can still guess the theme? You just want to see how it ends. Well, let's get right to it, then.

Finn@SLAM!@Candy Streets
Jake@Hey! I was trying to read that!@Candy Streets
Finn@That book is above your level.@Candy Streets

LSP@Ahh! it's terrible!@Candy Streets
Finn, Jake and Princess Bubblegum@Lumpy Space Princess!@Candy Streets
Princess Bubblegum@Whats wrong?!@Candy Streets
LSP@You guys! Somebody stole something from me! Something I can't live without!@Candy Streets
Princess Bubblegum@I'll get something to calm her down.@Candy Streets
LSP@I've been robbed! I've been robbed!@Candy Streets
Princess Bubblegum@Out of the way!@Candy Streets
Princess Bubblegum@I need help! Can you guys hold her down?@Candy Streets
LSP@Do something! I've been- ooh! Ohh!@Candy Streets
Princess Bubblegum@Oops.@Candy Streets
Finn@LSP! Who robbed you?@Candy Streets
LSP@It...was...puh...pee...pete...sa...sas...as...@Candy Streets
Princess Bubblegum@I think I gave her too much.@Candy Streets
Finn@Jake. A crime has been committed. We must find the criminal.@Candy Streets
Jake@We must.@Candy Streets
Finn@And retrieve whatever it is that was stolen from Lumpy Space Princess.@Candy Streets
Jake@Stolen. But all we have to go on is part of a name. Pete something. Need more clues! Hold me!@Candy Streets
Finn@Clues, clues, clues.@Candy Streets
Finn@What's that? I can't see it.@Candy Streets
Jake@Oop, sorry. Aah!@Candy Streets
Finn@There's something in her hand! A key! A key to...what? Three zero three. Hmm.@Candy Streets
Jake@Ooh, turn it around!@Candy Streets
Finn@Ah! Looks like we've got our first lead!@Candy Streets
Finn@Hmm. Find anything, Jake?@Candy Streets
Jake@Got some bags and...wait- more bags. But no leads on Pete something.@Candy Streets
Finn@Same here. BMO. Start marking evidence.@Candy Streets
Jake@Hmm.@Candy Streets
Finn@Hmm.@Candy Streets
BMO@Hmm.@Candy Streets
Finn@Dude, check this! Is this blood?@Candy Streets
Jake@Yeah man, that's definitely blood.@Candy Streets
Finn@Hmm. LSP's injuries were 100 percent emotional. So it has to belong to Pete Sa-something. BMO, take a sample and do a full blood analysis. The works. Hey, if that guy cut himself during the robbery, he might have gone somewhere to buy a mini adhesive bandage. There's a drugstore across the street!@Candy Streets
Jake@Let's roll.@Candy Streets
Finn@Woah!@Candy Streets
Ann@And if the oozing persists, just come back and I'll give you something a little stronger.@Candy Streets
Finn@I'm Finn. This is my partner, Jake.@Candy Streets
Jake@Hello, citizen. Had anyone in here looking to buy some mini adhesive bandages today?@Candy Streets
Ann@A lot of people come through my store, gentlemen. You can't seriously think I'd be able to remember any one particular customer among the countless others I see on a daily basis, now, can you?@Candy Streets
Finn@I guess not. Fair dues. C'mon, Jake.@Candy Streets
Ann@Wait! Now that you mention it, there was this one guy in here earlier. Real suspicious type. Had a nosebleed. Said it was the first one he'd had in years. Used to get them all the time as a kid, he said. Can never remember if he was supposed to pinch his nose and hold his head back, or pinch his nose and hold his head forward. Maybe it was a case of being boxed on the nose too many times. Made the blood vessels in his lower septum weak and vulnerable to hemorrhaging. Anyway, his mammy always said it was because he couldn't keep all those picky little fingers out of his dirty little nose holes. He didn't buy it though. He always thought it had-@Candy Streets
Finn@Ma'am, can you give us a name?@Candy Streets
Ann@Mmm, nope. No wait, yes I can. Pete Sassafras.@Candy Streets
Finn@Did you catch which way he was going?@Candy Streets
Ann@Of course! He said he was catching a train at 1127, Candy Kingdom Station, Platform 5. Heh. Sorry, I wish I could remember more.@Candy Streets
Jake@See anyone who might be our guy?@Candy Streets
Finn@Nope. Nobody's suspicious here. Just a load of decent law-abiding folk. What the-?! Jake! What's with all the turning into stuff today?@Candy Streets
Jake@I really like turnin' into cop stuff. I literally can't stop turning into cop stuff. Hey, there's Platform 5! I see a nasty tranch!@Candy Streets
Finn@Let's book him, son.@Candy Streets
Finn@Stop right there! What's under that skeezy trenchcoat ya-@Candy Streets
Blueberry Cop 1@Crook! Busted! For attempting to board a train without a ticket.@Candy Streets
Finn@Oh, guys, he's getting away!@Candy Streets
Jake@We're not criminals, man! We're working the beat, just like you!@Candy Streets
Blueberry Cop 1@Jimmy?@Candy Streets
Blueberry Cop 2 (Jimmy)@Yup. Checks out. He tastes like police.@Candy Streets
Blueberry Cop 1@Sorry about that, officers, it was an honest mistake.@Candy Streets
Finn@Ugh. We lost him.@Candy Streets
Jake@Not yet we didn't!@Candy Streets
Finn@Ugh! It's too far ahead! We'll never catch it.@Candy Streets
Jake@If we cut through the forest, maybe we can head it off at the pass.@Candy Streets
Finn@Sweet thinkin'.@Candy Streets
Finn and Jake@Yeah!@Candy Streets
Finn@Are you Pete Sassafras?@Candy Streets
Pete Sassafras@Wha-? Uh, I got a lot of names. Who's askin'?@Candy Streets
Jake@Give back what you stole from LSP!@Candy Streets
Pete Sassafras@Who? What's that, an acronym or somethin'?@Candy Streets
Finn@Cuff 'em.@Candy Streets
Jake@Ehh, I got this. You have the right to remain... busted.@Candy Streets
Pete Sassafras@Alright, you listen, flatfoot. There's been some kind of crazy mistake here. I didn't do nothin'!@Candy Streets
Jake@Save it for the candy judge, Pete.@Candy Streets
Finn@Look, you can cut the act and drop the sass, Sassafras. We've got an eye-witness and your blood at the scene of the crime.@Candy Streets
Jake@You do the crime, you do the time, man!@Candy Streets
Finn@Roll the dice, you pay the price.@Candy Streets
Pete Sassafras@What dice? Oh, you guys are donkers.@Candy Streets
Jake@Burgle our friend, it's the end. For you!@Candy Streets
Pete Sassafras@I wanna see a lawyer.@Candy Streets
Lawyer@I'll handle this, Pete. You're upsetting my client. Just look at that face. That constitutes harassment, so give him some space. Don't worry buddy, I got this case.@Candy Streets
"Lawyer"@Welcome to the next twenty-five years of your life.@Candy Streets
Finn@We deserve donuts.@Candy Streets
Jake@Let's ball.@Candy Streets
Pete Sassafras@No, wait, please! You guys!@Candy Streets
"Lawyer"@Guilty!@Candy Streets
Finn@Man, we didn't just crack that case, we crunched it! Crumbled it!@Candy Streets
Jake@We are awesome at being cops! No question about that.@Candy Streets
Finn@Call me crazy, but I was thinking maybe we should actually become detectives. Like, as a job! When we were out on the streets back there, getting those leads, busting that perp, it just felt so...I don't know...right.@Candy Streets
Jake@I know, man. I actually totally do know exactly what you mean.@Candy Streets
Finn@Aw, dude.@Candy Streets
Jake@I told you I have a problem. I can't stop!@Candy Streets
BMO@Howdy, partner.@Candy Streets
Finn@Oh hey, BMO. What's going on?@Candy Streets
BMO@I finished processing the blood sample. And I have the result.@Candy Streets
Finn@Nice!@Candy Streets
Jake@Yeah, good work, BMO!@Candy Streets
Finn@It's Pete Sassafras's blood, right?@Candy Streets
BMO@No. It doesn't belong to anyone because it's not blood. It's tomato sauce.@Candy Streets
Jake@Tomato sauce?@Candy Streets
Finn@Hmm... Oh my mind! LSP wasn't trying to say "Pete Sa-something", She was trying to say "Pizza something!"@Candy Streets
Jake@But how would pizza sauce end up in a hotel room?@Candy Streets
Finn@Unless it was delivered.@Candy Streets
Finn and Jake@Pizza Sassy's!@Candy Streets
Finn@Where's the delivery guy?!@Candy Streets
Man behind the counter@Oh, you mean Petey. He's out. He's makin' deliveries.@Candy Streets
Jake@Or maybe he's out tying up loose ends!@Candy Streets
Finn@LSP could be in danger!@Candy Streets
Jake@Danger!@Candy Streets
Finn@Phone?@Candy Streets
Man behind the counter@Phone.@Candy Streets
Finn@Princess! Have some Banana Guards outside of LSP's hospital room!@Candy Streets
Princess Bubblegum@Huh? Why?@Candy Streets
Finn@LSP could be in danger!@Candy Streets
Princess Bubblegum@LSP woke up and went back to her hotel room.@Candy Streets
Finn@OH MY JAM!!!@Candy Streets

Woman behind counter@Can I help you?@Candy Streets
Finn and Jake@LSP! @Candy Streets
LSP@It was you! You did it!@Candy Streets
Petey@Help me! I was just delivering the pizzas she ordered. And now she won't let me leave.@Candy Streets
Finn@LSP, what is going on? You said he stole something from you.@Candy Streets
LSP@He did! He stole...my heart!@Candy Streets
Finn@Hurry up, dude!@Candy Streets
Jake@Shh!@Candy Streets
Finn@Right.@Candy Streets
Petey@Thanks!@Candy Streets
Finn@Shh. Go, go!@Candy Streets
Petey@Yeah, no tip, huh? That's great. That's how it is, around here. Fine.@Candy Streets
Jake@Huh, huh? Come on pal. Turns out the only case here is just another case of LSP being nutty!@Candy Streets

Nurse Pound Cake@Look, I'm a nurse and all, but my uncle is a magic worker and he cured my sadness about my marriage.@Wizards Only, Fools
Princess Bubblegum@Listen, all magic is scientific principles presented like mystical hoo-doo, which is fun but it's sort of irresponsible. I got your magic right here, okay? And razzle dazzle! Flooby-doo! Zamabamafoo!@Wizards Only, Fools
Starchie@Is that a real spell?@Wizards Only, Fools
Princess Bubblegum@No, I'm making fun of spells.@Wizards Only, Fools

Princess Bubblegum@Starchie, I just want to help.@Wizards Only, Fools

Princess Bubblegum@He's still sick.@Wizards Only, Fools
Jake@Yo, that stinks! Tonight's part 3 of his graveyard secrets workshop.@Wizards Only, Fools

Princess Bubblegum@Well, then what?@Wizards Only, Fools
Finn@Let's stay home. Just kidding.@Wizards Only, Fools
Princess Bubblegum@All right, meet me outside of Wizard City in your freshest wizard johns.@Wizards Only, Fools
Starchie@H-hurry, princess.@Wizards Only, Fools
Finn@This is it?@Wizards Only, Fools
Jake@Yeah, man, this is it.@Wizards Only, Fools
Finn@Well, what's with the wall?@Wizards Only, Fools
Jake@Wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-op!@Wizards Only, Fools
Finn@What's over there?@Wizards Only, Fools
Jake@Nothing. Just more mountains. I think the wall knows we're not wizards.@Wizards Only, Fools
Finn@But we can trick it, right?@Wizards Only, Fools
Jake@How do you trick a wall?@Wizards Only, Fools
Finn@Don't know, man. I give up.@Wizards Only, Fools
Jake@For reals?@Wizards Only, Fools
Finn@Yeah, I'm no good at this! Unh! Oof!@Wizards Only, Fools
Jake@That was a nice try, man.@Wizards Only, Fools
Princess Bubblegum@Guys, hold up! I got the password from the Ice King. Apparently, the barrier only responds to the voice of real wizards.@Wizards Only, Fools
Ice King@No way! I'm no rat! I am bound by the sacred trust of esoteric knowledge!@Wizards Only, Fools
Princess Bubblegum@Say the password, Ice King!@Wizards Only, Fools
Ice King@You think I'll just hand you the keys to the city? I'd rather die.@Wizards Only, Fools
Princess Bubblegum@Say the password.@Wizards Only, Fools
Ice King@Ow! My pinky! Ow. Thank you. You know, no one has touched me in months. Could you touch me again?@Wizards Only, Fools
Princess Bubblegum@Password! Now!!'@Wizards Only, Fools
Ice King@Ow! Ohh! Ohh! "Wizards Rule!" THE PASSWORD IS WIZARDS RULE!" AAH--@Wizards Only, Fools
Finn@Whoa. Powerful magicks.@Wizards Only, Fools
Princess Bubblegum@Pshh! It's a vocal registry rigged to a vibration modulator. The wall's still there. It's just the density's all wobbled.@Wizards Only, Fools
Jake@Boo.@Wizards Only, Fools
Princess Bubblegum@Um...That's what it is, Jake.@Wizards Only, Fools
Jake@All right, what am I, then? This don't look like magic to you?@Wizards Only, Fools
Princess Bubblegum@It looks like a mutation.@Wizards Only, Fools
Jake@Boring.@Wizards Only, Fools
Princess Bubblegum@Yeah, right. Just 'cause I know my shnoz. Look at these dopes. Half of these spells are all working on entanglement principles.@Wizards Only, Fools
Finn@"Entanglement" is a spell where you get trapped in tree roots, and sometimes they spike out and hook your flesh, and you got to be like, "My body is clay, my spirit feels no pain." Then you chop your way out and kill the wizard!@Wizards Only, Fools
Princess Bubblegum@That's not what I meant, but whatevs. Where's this magic shop?@Wizards Only, Fools
Finn@These signs are weird. Let's ask somebody. Hey, dudes. Yo, where's the--@Wizards Only, Fools

Ron James@Welcome, brothers! Sorry about that biz outside.@Wizards Only, Fools
Princess Bubblegum@Ha ha ha! Oh, what a silly non-magic user, right?@Wizards Only, Fools
Ron James@All right, bros. Ronny James got mad spells for wizards of all exps. No need for memorization, incantation, or hard-to-find bularoo. Just rip one of these babies open, and you'll be like, "ta-da!" We got a bottle-returns program and all that shwazaa. So, wha-za?@Wizards Only, Fools
Jake@We need a spell for the cold.@Wizards Only, Fools
Ron James@Heck, yeah, brah. I got something. Oof! This baby right here — right here? — This is what you want, brothers.@Wizards Only, Fools

Wizard Policeman@Receive your just punishment!@Wizards Only, Fools
Princess Bubblegum@No! As ruler of the Candy Kingdom, I demand parley with the Grand Master Wizard!@Wizards Only, Fools
Grand Master Wizard@Princess Bubblegum! For shame. And I'm very disappointed in you, Abracadaniel! However, Princess, since you have always been a dear friend to the wizard community, just say "Wizards Rule" and you're all free to go.@Wizards Only, Fools
Abracadaniel@Wha-? Really?@Wizards Only, Fools
Grand Master Wizard@Mmm?@Wizards Only, Fools
Jake@Psst! Wizards rule!@Wizards Only, Fools

Jake@Nooo!@Jake Suit
Finn@Ride 'em cowboy! Woo!@Jake Suit
Jake@You were a little rough with the Jakesuit today, bro. You mashed up my doggy bag pretty hard.@Jake Suit
Finn@Why didn't you stop me?@Jake Suit
Jake@When you're in my body, it pushes out my brain, so I have no control.@Jake Suit
Finn@C'mon bro, taking pain is easy. You just have to imagine that every bruise is a hickey from the Universe. And everyone wants to get with the Universe.@Jake Suit
Jake@I bet you wouldn't be saying that nonsense if I wore you as a suit.@Jake Suit
Finn@I bet I would be saying that nonsense.@Jake Suit
Jake@OK bro, let's see how you like it. I'll bring the pain!@Jake Suit
Finn@Do it bro, get in here!@Jake Suit
Jake@Haha yes! Time to bring the pain!@Jake Suit
Jake@Eh?@Jake Suit
Finn@Man, are you kidding?@Jake Suit
Jake@You give up?@Jake Suit
Finn@You have to like, punch me in the face.@Jake Suit
Jake@Hmm. I thought I was. This is hard. I can't even make a fist. How do you control my body so well?@Jake Suit
Finn@Dude, I'm graceful. Mom raised me graceful.@Jake Suit
Finn@Dude, what the Bjork?@Jake Suit
Jake@A-ha! Here we go! Dream Journal of a Boring Man, Volume 12.@Jake Suit
Finn@Uh, Jake, what are you doing?@Jake Suit
Jake@There's all kinds of pain, Finn.@Jake Suit
Finn@Dude, come on, don't do this.@Jake Suit
Jake@Ah. Okay, let's see. Ooh, this one looks good. And it's not too long, only seven pages! Okay, here we go. "In my dream, I was eating jasmine rice. But it was also brown rice. And it was also my mother."@Jake Suit
Jake@Huh? Where am I? Oh, yeah. Hey, Finn, how long have I been out?@Jake Suit
Finn@I don't know. A couple hours@Jake Suit
Jake@Say what?! Why are you still reading?@Jake Suit
Finn@It's actually not that bad. There's a bunch where he knows he's dreaming. Here, let me read you a little. "So I said to the first guy, if everyone in my dream is me, then you are me. And he said, I am who? And I said, me. And he said, who is me? And I said, you. And he said, what about you? And I said, no you!" It's like he's trying to solve a mystery that doesn't exist! You want me to keep going?@Jake Suit
Jake@No, I'm hungry.@Jake Suit
Finn@Yeah, I'm hungry too. How about a truce while you go make us some lunch?@Jake Suit
Jake@Oh, I didn't know we were allowed to call truces. I'll totally remember that the next time my doggy bag is hurtling towards a fence post.@Jake Suit
Finn@You know, you could use the opportunity of cooking me food to mess with me.@Jake Suit
Jake@Wait a sec, you just gave me an idea!@Jake Suit
Finn@Yeah? Uh-oh. Oh, look out, you gonna make me something gross? Soemthing spicy? You know I can take it!@Jake Suit
Jake@Ta-Daa!!@Jake Suit
Finn@Meatloaf? That's my favorite dish.@Jake Suit
Jake@Mmm-mmm.@Jake Suit
Finn@What did you do to it?@Jake Suit
Jake@I assure you, it's delicious.@Jake Suit
Finn@Okay, well, you're really terrible at this.@Jake Suit
Jake@Yummy!@Jake Suit
Finn@Oh, that's just mean.@Jake Suit
Jake@Admit you're wrong, and you can have some of this delicious meatloaf!@Jake Suit
Finn@Nah, I'm good.@Jake Suit
Finn@Jake, it's my special occasion phone! Someone's calling me to tell me about a special occasion.@Jake Suit
Jake@So?@Jake Suit
Finn@So can you walk me over there? I wanna see who it is! Oh, it's Flame Princess. I'll talk to her later. I don't want you embarrassing me or, uh, anything.@Jake Suit
Finn@Jake! Seriously, don't do this!@Jake Suit
Jake@Tell me I win, dude!@Jake Suit
Finn@No, absolutely not.@Jake Suit
Jake@Alright. Say goodbye to Flame Princess thinking you're cool! I'm gonna embarrass the Bjork outta you!@Jake Suit
Flame Princess@Oh, hey, you came! I got worried because you didn't answer special occasion phone. My relatives are waiting inside.@Jake Suit
Finn@What?@Jake Suit
Flame Princess@Well, that's why I called on special occasion phone. All my less-evil family members are here for dinner. Come eat!@Jake Suit
Flame Princess@Finn, this is my family. These are my two younger brothers, my brother who's home from the military, and my judgmental aunt and uncle.@Jake Suit
Finn@Jake, whatever you're about to do, please don't do it.@Jake Suit
Older brother@What are you doing in front of my family?!@Jake Suit
Flame Princess@Hold on, bro. Perhaps it is a non-flameish custom unknown to us.@Jake Suit
Jake@Nope! Just doin' the kind of stuff I do all the time!@Jake Suit
Older brother@This is a nightmare come true for me, sister.@Jake Suit
Flame Princess@What are you doing?!@Jake Suit
Jake@Don't you wanna see more?@Jake Suit
Flame Princess@Oh, my Bjork! No! I don't want to see more! Wait, what's that in your mouth? Jake?@Jake Suit
Jake@Oops! Busted.@Jake Suit
Flame Princess@Are you controlling Finn?@Jake Suit
Jake@Yeah, I'm causing Finn pain. We have a bet going on.@Jake Suit
Flame Princess@And you made him dance like a baby, semi-nude, in front of my family? Wow, that's pretty hardcore.@Jake Suit
Jake@What?@Jake Suit
Flame Princess@Good luck, Finn. Hope you win!@Jake Suit
Finn@I will!@Jake Suit
Jake@Hmm!@Jake Suit
Lady Rainicorn@Finn! Oh, of all days! Where are you going? Jake, where are you?@Jake Suit

Lady Rainicorn@Oh!@Jake Suit
T.V.@'Sup?@Jake Suit
Jake@What's T.V. doing here? I thought all the kids found apartments.@Jake Suit
Lady Rainicorn@No matter what, I think he's stay-at-home.@Jake Suit
Jake@Ha-ha! That's my boy. Momma's basement baby.@Jake Suit
Lady Rainicorn@Jake, what are you doing? Please tell me.@Jake Suit
Jake@Oh, it's this bet we're doing. It's not really a bet. It's more like a showdown. I'm trying to get him to admit that it's hard when someone wears you as a suit. How do I win the bet, Lady?@Jake Suit
T.V.@Hey, Dad? Why don't you try jumping in a volcano?@Jake Suit
Jake@Yes!@Jake Suit
Finn@So, what are we doing, bro?@Jake Suit
Jake@The Universe is going to have a full-on make-out session with you, bro. I'm talkin' minimum tier 8. Behold!@Jake Suit
Finn@Fire Wolves? That's your plan? Please.@Jake Suit
Jake@Oh no, bro, that's just fortuitous circumstance! Allow me to take advantage! here, pup pups! Want some kibble? Want steak flavor? Steaky-steaks?@Jake Suit
Jake@How you like it, bro? Pretty painful, huh?@Jake Suit
Finn@Eh, whatev.@Jake Suit
Finn@Hmm. Looks hot.@Jake Suit
Jake@Oh yeah, bro! The pain-train has arrived at the station! Choo-choo!@Jake Suit
Finn@I'm ready, bro! Bring it! You're nothin', lava! You're a bum! I can handle you!@Jake Suit
Jake@Look, just say stop, and you won't get burned.@Jake Suit
Finn@Never!@Jake Suit
Jake@Okay, bro. This'll pretty much wreck up your whole life, so think about it.@Jake Suit
Finn@Bring it! Yeah, baby, feels good, love it, lovin' that heat on my skull!@Jake Suit
Jake@Okay...I'm gonna lower you some more...probably gonna cook up your brain.@Jake Suit
Finn@Oh, yeah, give it to me!@Jake Suit
Jake@Dang, he's flippin' crazy! This isn't gonna do anything, he's never gonna give up!@Jake Suit
Finn@What happened? You robbed me of the win!@Jake Suit
Jake@You're right, man. My bruises are hickeys from the Universe. And I should just accept that.@Jake Suit
Finn@Yeah boy! In yo' face!@Jake Suit
Jake@Yeah, in my face.@Jake Suit

Finn@BMO, are you okay?@Be More
Jake@What did you do?@Be More
BMO@It wasn't me. I didn't do noth- do noth- do nothing.@Be More
Finn@Come on BMO. We got to get you to the hospital or whatevs.@Be More
BMO@No, no. I am fine. Really. Oh, yes. Okay. Please take me to get fixed. I need- need- need- need to get new core system drivers installed. We can get them at the MO Factory in the Bad Lands, where I was born.@Be More
Finn@The MO Factory?@Be More
BMO@Yeah. I am programmed with emergency instructions to get there. Come on! There's no- no- no- no- no time to lo- lo- lo- lo- lose.@Be More
BMO@Okay. Now straight down this place. Okay, now take a right- right- right- right- left up here. The instructions also say that damaged MOs get a full memory-wipe before repairs. Don't let on what happened... or all the years we've been spent together will vanish like tears in the oven!@Be More
Finn@Tears in the oven? But memories are real, real cruc'!@Be More
BMO@Yeah, no fooling. Oh wait, there's more! It says here only MOs are allowed in the factory. Wait what? Oh, that's just great.@Be More
Jake@Hey, hey. Don't worry buddy. We're Finn and Jake, remember? Or should I say... Finn and JMO!@Be More

Jake@Hey there, DMO. I am JMO.@Be More
Finn@And I'm FMO!@Be More
DMO@Greetings, JMO. FMO, you look ridiculous. Are you damaged? Are you in need of repair?@Be More
Finn@Yes, absolutely. Thanks, DMO. I busted my core system drivers, and now I need new ones.@Be More
DMO@Fantastic. Okay. Please get ready for your total personality wipe.@Be More
Finn@Oh, right, right. Uh, right. I mean, no. I'm just here for the... nostalgic purposes.@Be More
DMO@Ah, yes. 47.3% of MOs eventually return to the factory for assorted sentimental biz. Please step 100% on the ultra-tram for your complimentary tour.@Be More
DMO@Greetings.@Be More
Finn@Wup!@Be More
DMO@We are now passing over the famous factory floor. Birthplace of each and every MO. Behold the gleaming machinery! Teeming and wild with the throes of real creation. From this unlikely chaos emerges every shiny new MO.@Be More
Jake@But nothing's moving down there. It's all shut down. What happened to this place?@Be More
DMO@I'm sorry. I'm just a tram MO. I'm not programmed to understand that question. Also, you're just a JMO. You're not programmed to ask that question.@Be More
Jake@Uh, what question?@Be More
DMO@That question-@Be More
Jake@I'm serious...@Be More
DMO@Anyway, MO Co. was founded over 1,000 years ago. By Moseph Mastro Giovanni. A sad and gentle man. Beloved by only those he built to belove him. On your left, you'll see the core system driver installation port bay.@Be More
BMO@Finn! Finn! That's it! That's where the driver ports are!@Be More
Finn@I know, I heard!@Be More
DMO@What?! Are you crazy?! Get back here!@Be More
Jake@Hurry, Finn. I think he's calling the police or somethin'!@Be More
Finn@None of these ports fit right! E, D, C, where's the B port?!@Be More
SMO 1@Intruder spotted! Prepare to vaporize! Vaporize!@Be More
SMO 1@Cease fire! No intruder spotted. Vaporization complete.@Be More
SMO 2@Um, but what if they slipped past us, sir? In all the smoke?@Be More
SMO 1@Allllright, everyone. About face. Does anyone see the intruders now? Like I said, vaporization complete. Now let's head back to base. It's donut o' clock.@Be More
SMO 3@Man, how about those goofs? Tryin' to mess with our drivers?@Be More
SMO 4@Yeah. You know the world these days. All goofs.@Be More
SMO 1@Hey! You toss me one of them 'nuts? Ah. Yeah, hey, speaking of goofs? Haven't seen SMO 5681 lately.@Be More
SMO 3@Man, that goof.@Be More
SMO 1@Yeah, I hate that goof. You ever notice goofs always askin' how you're doin'? What is that? Uh, yeah, I'm fine.@Be More
SMO 3@Yeah, 100%.@Be More
SMO 1@Oh! Hey, what are you doing over there by yourself?@Be More
SMO 5@Uh, oh, I-- I'm sad.@Be More
SMO 1@Oh, yeah, y'know we've all been there. So anyway, how's your goofy wife doin'?@Be More
Finn@BMO, how are you doing?@Be More
BMO@Get me close to that guy's port. I can hack into his computer and find out where my driver port is!@Be More
Jake@Ah, we gotta hustle!@Be More
SMO 1@Yeah, pretty good, I guess. I prefer something yeastier. The wife is always giving me grief about that. But I mean, what am I, decent?@Be More
SMO 4@Hey, what are you two goofs doin'? Goofing?@Be More
Jake@Dang, man, how deep does this place go?@Be More

Jake@Wait, what's up?@Be More
Moe@Hey, I'm Moe! Don't worry! My legs don't work!@Be More

Moe@My skin is human!@Be More
Jake@Dude, how old are you?!@Be More
Moe@Hey, come on, now! It is BMO! Looks like there's some software problems! Hmm.@Be More
Finn@So...you made BMO?@Be More
Jake@Hey, you're not gonna reset our friend's personality, are you?@Be More
Moe@Huh? What? No...BMO's one of a kind. I built BMO to take care of my son. Oh, thank you. But I guess I never ended up dating any women. So, that's sad. I sent BMO off into the world alone. Hoping to find a family home. And then maybe even find somebody else's little boy to take care of.@Be More
Finn@Aw.@Be More
Moe@Oh, there's that back-up driver disk! Thank you. That oughta done it. I must've built what, like, a million MOs. But BMO is very, very special. I built BMO to understand fun. And how to play. You see, I made BMO to be more.@Be More
BMO@Ooh! Are you my grandpoop?@Be More
Moe@Nah, I'm just your poop.@Be More
Jake@Wait, did you say you built a million robots?@Be More
Finn@Yeah, all we saw was that tram jerk and all those jerky security jerks!@Be More
Moe@Ah, those were just the surface jerks. Up, please. Kid, come over here. BMO, say hello to your family.@Be More
BMO@Hello, family.@Be More
MOs@Hi, BMO!@Be More
Princess Bubblegum@Okay, okay, I'm up. Ah!@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Hey, everybody. I've asked you here today because you are the best of the best.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Anyway, recent data shows an increased chance of threat to the Candy Kingdom.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@So I'm developing a new defense. I've installed sleeping gas in the Gumball Guardians. If any bum tries to attack us, they will be sprayed without mercy. Isn't that nice? The only thing is the gas will spread and knock out anyone who breathes it—anyone but you guys, my trained elite. So watch closely. I'm gonna show you all how to overcome the gas with sheer willpower. Hit it!@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Now make a fist with your brain and punch against sleepy times, saying, "No! NOOO! NOOOOO! Don't go on gentle into that good night."@Sky Witch
Cinnamon Bun@Hi!@Sky Witch
Marceline@Yo, Bubblegum!@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Marceline! You're up late.@Sky Witch
Marceline@No time for chitchat. Let's hang out—right now.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Hmm, I don't know. I'm, uh, kinda busy.@Sky Witch
Cinnamon Bun@Uh, hi.@Sky Witch
Marceline@Listen, Bub-Bubs. I tracked down Maja the Sky Witch.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, what?!@Sky Witch
Marceline@Yeah, I tailed her to an enchanted forest, but it's all jammed up with barrier spells.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Ohhh, I think I see where this is going.@Sky Witch
Marceline@Well, you love getting out your big brain and... and... I just thought it'd be cool to spend some quality time with you. I need your help, okay?@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@But why are you so interested in finding Maja?@Sky Witch
Marceline@It's just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really important to me.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Whoa. Okay, but—@Sky Witch
Marceline@Come on, I got your pack-pack.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Um, sure, but—@Sky Witch
Marceline@Hold on to that "but," PB. @Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Whee!@Sky Witch
Cinnamon Bun@Haha! Whee.@Sky Witch
Marceline@Gah! Something's wrong. Huh? Hey! This stuff—it's like a brick wall! Let's just blow the whole thing up.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Hmmm. It's a Sleeping Gate Bramble.@Sky Witch
Marceline@How do we kill it?@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@All we have to do is take the path of least resistance.@Sky Witch
Marceline@Alright, so where is it—the path?@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@It's in here and in here . Now take a deep breath and be passive.@Sky Witch
Marceline@Grrrr!@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Hello, friend. Trouble relaxing? How 'bout a cup of chamomile tea?@Sky Witch
Marceline@Wow! Wild digs.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Tell me about it. My googoomamameter is going babies. And look at my watch!@Sky Witch
Marceline@It's... pink.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@It's running backwards. There's serious witchery afoot here.@Sky Witch
Marceline@Come on, Princess. We don't got all night.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@What are those things?@Sky Witch
Marceline@Totem cairns.@Sky Witch
Marceline@That's Maja's Crabbit Familiar.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Wibba-wha?@Sky Witch
Hambo@Marceline! It's me!@Sky Witch
Marceline@Hambo!@Sky Witch
Hambo@Yeah, girl. What took you so long? I thought you gave up on me.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Your teddy bear?@Sky Witch
Marceline@I'm sorry, man!@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Yo, wait a sec!@Sky Witch
Marceline@WHAT?!@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Marcy, how old are you? It's a trick, right? Come on!@Sky Witch
Hambo@Help me out, dum-dum! Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo@Sky Witch
Marceline@Get off! Buddy!@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@NO!@Sky Witch
Marceline@BONNIE!@Sky Witch
Marceline@You killed him?@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Don't be dense! Hambo can't even talk! Snap out of it, girl.@Sky Witch
Marceline@He's been with a witch this whole time. Maybe he can talk now.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@That's seriously what this is about? Rescuing your old teddy bear?@Sky Witch
Marceline@Yeah. Sorry I didn't tell you. You might not have come otherwise.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Um, yeah. Raggedy Princess can make you a new Hambo in, like, three seconds... or Raggedy Princess can be your new Hambo. She'd do it, too. That girl's got, like, zero self-respect. That's mean—don't tell her I said that.@Sky Witch
Marceline@I'm not getting a new Hambo. There's only one Hambo.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@It's just a doll.@Sky Witch
Marceline@See this? Voooooooo...@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@What's that? You gonna bop me one?@Sky Witch
Marceline@It's comin' in for a landing. What'cha gonna do, PB? Wanna keep dissing Hambo?@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@I'm sorry, Marceline. Let's go get Hambo.@Sky Witch
Marceline@Disengage.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@We should track that bird-rabbit thing.@Sky Witch
Marceline@Right.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Hmm. Bang. There goes some broken branches. It left a trail.@Sky Witch
Marceline@I see it.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Hey! Hold on now! This bag's mad heavy!@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Glommit! MARCELINE! I thought you needed my help. Huh. Nice trick, Maja. You in there, Marceline? Hyup!@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@WHOAAAA! Woof. Okay, PB, use your brain. Where would this witch keep Hambo? Break it down. Micro... and macro... the picture... becomes... clear... and... call it! Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, wait... yes.@Sky Witch
Marceline@Where are you, Maja, you creep? Oof. What? Hambo! No!@Sky Witch
Crabbit@Caw, caw!@Sky Witch
Marceline@You again. I'LL KILL YOU! Give me Ham— Uh!@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Jeez, man. This must be all of her stolen junk. Ugh, what a creep. Psh, a Ford Broncus. Hmm... Whoa! "My Privates"? Come here, biddy. Bam. Whoops! What the—? Invoices? Receipts? "Zumma zoom bleep blop for the purchase of Hambo." Whoa, WHAT?!@Sky Witch
Maja@That's my private box. Maja's mitts only, ya goof.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@So you purchased Hambo? From some weenus named Ash?@Sky Witch
Maja@That's right. He was a weenus so I wrote it on there as my personal joke. But the sale is still legit. Hambo's mine! His body's all juice-logged with sentimental affection—a savory spell spice. So get out of my face, alright?@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Where's Marceline?@Sky Witch
Maja@She's busy with my Crabbit... crow-bit... crow-rabbit. I knew that tranch wouldn't respect my proof of purchase. So what about you, bozo?@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@By the laws of my kingdom, I must honor the exchange of goods for legal tender. But guess what—I'm not leaving without Hambo.@Sky Witch
Maja@So what are you gonna do about it?@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@Marceline! Yoink!@Sky Witch
Marceline@Hambo! Oh, it's me, buddy! How did you—?@Sky Witch
Princess Bubblegum@I took care of it. Let's bust out.@Sky Witch
Crabbit@They got away with your Hambo.@Sky Witch
Maja@Huh-duh! I let them!@Sky Witch
Crabbit@You what?@Sky Witch
Maja@I made a trade... for this! Bing! Mmmmm. Sentimental freshness! Ah, the psychic resonance on Hambo is nothing compared to this baby! WHOO! Hahahaha!@Sky Witch
Crabbit@Listen, Maja. I am not your familiar anymore. I wanna be a dancer.@Sky Witch
Maja@That's cool. Then why don't you dance to this?!@Sky Witch
Crabbit@AAAH!@Sky Witch
Maja@Nice moves! Now you're the weenus! Hey, don't go! Ahahahahaha! I'm cookin' up something big, Crabbit! This is my victory lap! Ahahahahaha!@Sky Witch

Jake@That's weird. I had a dream too. I'll tell you about it!@Frost and Fire
Jake@So then paintings were found and everybody's eyes lit up. Cinnamon Bun smiled and said "I saw it from miles away"...@Frost and Fire
Finn@Man, I need to have that dream again. I have to get Flame Princess to beat down Ice King again.@Frost and Fire
Flame Princess@Why'd you pick this spot?@Frost and Fire
Finn@Why does anyone do anything?@Frost and Fire
Flame Princess@Hmm...why do they?@Frost and Fire
Finn@Mmm?@Frost and Fire
Flame Princess@No thanks.@Frost and Fire
Finn@Suit yourself!@Frost and Fire

Flame Princess@What?!@Frost and Fire
Finn@Yeah, it's in the tone of his voice.@Frost and Fire
Flame Princess@What did you say to me?@Frost and Fire
Ice King@Uh, what? What did I say?@Frost and Fire
Flame Princess@It is in the tone of your voice.@Frost and Fire
Ice King@Look, just take whatever you want. Okay? Take it all! It's all just prunes! Prunes and liver! Frozen, of course.@Frost and Fire
Ice King@Ah. You might have what it takes to slap these old jowls, but do you have what it takes to face my- just a second... Legion of Snow Warriors?! Go, fight! Protect me! Oh, boy.@Frost and Fire
Flame Princess@I don't like being made fun of, Ice King. I don't like it at all!@Frost and Fire
Ice King@Woah!@Frost and Fire
Ice King@Oh, man. Times! I call time!@Frost and Fire
Flame Princess@It's only okay if the person making the fun is someone I'm cool with!@Frost and Fire
Ice King@We're totes cool! I-I'm Ice King!@Frost and Fire
Flame Princess@And they do it in a respectful and knowing way!@Frost and Fire
Ice King@Respect? I got all kinds of respect!@Frost and Fire
Flame Princess@Oh, yeah? Then what's with that stupid smirking face?@Frost and Fire
Ice King@Smirk? I smirk when I'm nervous.@Frost and Fire
Snow Monster@Bear hug!@Frost and Fire
Ice King@And also when I'm about to win! Booyah! And I didn't even get to test out my new fire-proof grundies!@Frost and Fire
Finn@Put it away, man! You didn't win nothing!@Frost and Fire
Finn@Are you okay? You feel... lukewarm.@Frost and Fire
Flame Princess@I-I just need to burn a couple of forests or something. And get a good night's sleep.@Frost and Fire

Finn@Milk. Milk. Play the sleep jam, BMO.@Frost and Fire
BMO@]@Frost and Fire
Finn@Mmm. What's cookin'? Smells good. Wha?! What?! Oh, no!@Frost and Fire
Finn@Jake! I had another dream. My body was being blasted. But this time, Ice King was blasting me with ice cubes! Aww. It was awful! And someone else was there. He was just laughing and laughing. He was in the first dream too, but he was whispering. I couldn't make out what he was saying. Oh, yeah! It was the Cosmic Owl!@Frost and Fire
Jake@What?! You didn't tell me the Cosmic Owl was there!@Frost and Fire
Finn@I couldn't see him last time!@Frost and Fire
Jake@Dude, that means it was a prophetic dream! You have to finish the original dream! Cosmic Owl could be whispering something wildly significant! You have to get Flame Princess and Ice King to fight again so you can see the end of the dream! Make 'em fight!@Frost and Fire
Finn@Dear Ice King, you smell like stink, you're unpleasant, you're not funny, you're old, blah blah blah, sincerely, the Flame Princess. P.S., let us fight.

Flame Princess@Finn!@Frost and Fire
Ice King@Ice. Whatever.@Frost and Fire
Flame Princess@I'm so, so sorry, Finn! Are you alright?@Frost and Fire
Finn@No, princess. I'm the one who's sorry. Ice King hasn't been picking fights with you, it's...it's been me all along.@Frost and Fire
Ice King@What?@Frost and Fire
Flame Princess@So, you wrote that letter?@Frost and Fire
Finn@Yes, but look, it's just like, I had this dream and it was because of that fight you had. It was weird, but I also liked it. But it was important because the Cosmic Owl was So I had to get you to beat up Ice King-@Frost and Fire
Flame Princess@Shh. I should have known. That letter said things in it that only you would know. Personal things, Finn. And you used them against me. I thought you were the one person I could- I need some time alone.@Frost and Fire
Finn@Princess!@Frost and Fire

Lemongrab@No. He needs to stay here. I hope you'll still be joining us for dessert.]@Too Old
Princess Bubblegum@We need to free that darling boy. Maybe there's something in the Candy Kingdom-Lemon Earldom treaty. I don't think there is.@Too Old
Finn@What about a prank?@Too Old
Princess Bubblegum@Finn, what are you talking about?@Too Old
Finn@Mmm, I don't know. Maybe if we prank Lemongrab, like, just right, they'll let us take that guy home? Yeah. Prank.@Too Old

Princess Bubblegum@Finn...@Too Old
Lemongrab 2@Lemon brothers! Stop! Stop and listen! It has cost me much, but I have learned that lemon need not squeeze lemon to survive. Lemonhope, go forth, grow strong, and return for us!@Too Old

Lemonhope@Yes, mistress.@Too Old
Jake@Yo, man, how's it going? Terrible?@Too Old
Finn@Well, yeah, mostly. But I think I learned something.@Too Old
Jake@Go on.@Too Old
Finn@Well, I'm thinkin' maybe age isn't just a number. Maybe older people, like, really are different. Y'know? Like, less fun inside.@Too Old
Jake@So whatcha saying here?@Too Old
Finn@I'm saying I think I really sponked up. I gotta patch things up with Flame Princess.@Too Old
Jake@Oh, dang! Didn't you hear? She's got a new boyfriend already!@Too Old

Finn, Jake, & Ice King@Aah!@Earth and Water
Finn & Jake@The Ice King? Grr—eh!@Earth and Water
Ice King@Jeez, you couldn't wait two seconds?@Earth and Water
Finn@Ech. Why are you stinkin' up our house?@Earth and Water
Ice King@Didn't you get my text? It said I'm stayin' with you guys— oh, didn't go through. Well, anyways, I knew you wouldn't mind since it's sorta your fault I'm homeless, right?@Earth and Water
Finn@Right.@Earth and Water
Ice King@'Cause you tricked your crazy ex into meltin' my Ice Kingdom?@Earth and Water
Finn@Mmhm.@Earth and Water
Ice King@With your lies and secrets? 'Member when that happened?@Earth and Water
Jake@Dude, you can't stay here if you're gonna stank it up with your bad vibes, man!@Earth and Water
Ice King@Yeah, I'm just crashing here while the penguins rebuild. I've given Gunter temporary reign.@Earth and Water
Ice King@Should be fine.@Earth and Water
Finn@Flame Princess isn't crazy.@Earth and Water
Ice King@You're blind, Finn. You're blind—wait, she isn't here, is she?@Earth and Water
Finn@No.@Earth and Water
Ice King@Whew!@Earth and Water
Finn@She said she wanted time to herself.@Earth and Water
Ice King@Yeesh.@Earth and Water
Jake@Yeah, breakups are tough.@Earth and Water
Ice King@Heh, yeah, like, remember how you and I were married?@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@Uh! It's so confusing!@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@Hmm? I thought Finn was a stand-up guy, you know? But he basically betrayed me.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@Why do people even have secrets?@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@It's like that in the Fire Kingdom, too. Everyone is all deceitful and Shakespeare. But out here doesn't seem any different. Why do I have to feel like this? And what is that noise?! Grrr!@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@Eh.@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@Yeah, yeah. Just act like I'm not here.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@Are you spying on me?!@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@What?! No, of course not!@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@I was observing you—for research. You're a threat, Flame Princess. Your emotions are directly linked to your combustion levels. But if I can create a scientific model that describes your complete elemental matrix, I can isolate and suppress your more... volatile traits.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@So, if you do your research, you'll know how to cut off my emotions so I won't feel like this?@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@Umm, yeah, basically!@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@Then I'll help you.@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@You will?@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@Yes. I'll do whatever it takes.@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@Once I press this button, you'll be subjected to a battery of tests to gauge your reflexes, stamina, and your reaction to various emotional stimuli.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@This is going to help me understand myself?@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@There's a 40% chance we'll be able to identify and isolate your chemical components—and yes, understand you in a very scientific way.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@Oh. That's good... I guess.@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@Initiate test. Yah. Hello?@Earth and Water
Jake@Princess! We need you and your Ball Blam Burglerber right away! Gunter has created a race of strangling snow snakes, or snow-a-constrictors!@Earth and Water
Jake@Aaaah—@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@Okay, Cinnamon Bun, all you have to do is write down the numbers that appear on this monitor. Can you do that one thing?@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@Yes.@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, one other thing. Do not open that door. So that's two things write down the numbers, do not open that door. Got it?@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@Yes, Princess.@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@Hello.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@Hello.@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@You look sad.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@Yeah, but mostly I'm confused.@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@Ha, me too.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@Really?@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@Yeah. Bubblegum is bad.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@She is?!@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@I don't know. Wanna pet my dog?! He lives at my house.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@What about the tests?@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@I'm not good at tests.@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@La-de-da-de-da His name is Jake, but he's not the real Jake. Ow. My body is soft.@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@We're friends.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@Yeah, I really get you, but sometimes friends are hard to understand. Sometimes you think you know them, but you find out they're just playing mind games.@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@Is the princess your friend?@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@I don't know.@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@Yeah, because why did she lock you up in jail when you were a little baby? That was a weird friend thing.@Earth and Water

Flame King@What do you want, princess of the Gum World?@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@I found your lost daughter.@Earth and Water
Flame King@I-I don't remember losing anything.@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@Pssh.@Earth and Water
Flame King@Okay, you got me. I had her sent to wander in the woods. I was in fear of being usurped. Come on.@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@That's your problem, but you can't just let her run around the woods. She's too dangerous. Find some way to contain her power, or I will.@Earth and Water
Flame King@Pssh, fine.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@Is everybody in this world hiding something?@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@It's fun to hide.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@You're all right. Why can't everybody be honest like you? Maybe I should just go back where I belong.@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@Wait, do you mean baby jail?@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@I don't know, man.@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@Mmmm...@Earth and Water
Finn@Fighting snow-a-constrictors really helped take my mind off things.@Earth and Water
Finn@So, uh, why am I here again?@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, I just wanted to measure Flame Princess's reaction when confronted by the guy who broke her heart.@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@Hey, Cinnamon Bun, I'm—@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@CINNAMON BUN!!!@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@There's a note "Gon 2 fyr kingdum. Pleez watch dog."@Earth and Water
Finn@Oh, this is terrible! If Flame Princess goes back there, her evil dad will lock her up again!@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@And if she's imprisoned, I won't be able to complete my tests, and I'll have wasted my precious time!@Earth and Water
Finn@We gotta save her. Let's doogie!@Earth and Water
Flame Guard #1@State your business here, and be quick about it. Sorry, I'm on edge 'cause I'm worried that Jerry here will find out I'm dating his sister.@Earth and Water
Finn@Listen, we need to get into the castle right now.@Earth and Water
Flame Guard #1@Yeah, but why?@Earth and Water
Finn@Grrr! So I can go to your mama's house! Now get outta my way!@Earth and Water
Jerry@Doesn't your mom live in a nursing home?@Earth and Water
Flame Guard #1@Yeah, and in a different city. C'mon, dude, you gotta be honest here.@Earth and Water
Finn@Honest my fist! Come on, Princess!@Earth and Water
Flame Guard #2@D'aw, yeah! Gonna scramble you and fry you up for brunch! I try to act tough but I really wanted to be a chef.@Earth and Water
Finn@Man.@Earth and Water
Jerry@Halt. What is your business here?@Earth and Water
Flame Person@I need to get inside to file my taxes. Also I like using the bathroom here. Also I like to crop dust the lobby.@Earth and Water
Flame Guard #2@Pass, friend.@Earth and Water
Finn@Alright, so you wanna get nasty? One time, I blew a snot bubble that broke off and floated away. Then it hit some lady's baby in the face, and it started crying.@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@And I really enjoy the taste of envelopes.@Earth and Water
Flame Guard #1@Uh, that's cool and all, but you still haven't told us why you want to get in.@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@We need to see the king?@Earth and Water
Flame Guard #1@Well, why didn't you just say so? Right this way, friends. There you go the new Flame King.@Earth and Water
Finn@Flame Princess?@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@Finn?@Earth and Water
Finn@You're okay! Um, how's it going?@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@Pretty good. Cinnamon Bun and I staged a coup and I overthrew my dad.@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@Oh-ho, that's why the guards were wigging out.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@That is the new way in the Fire Kingdom. Total honesty is the law of the land—no secrets.@Earth and Water
Finn@Oh.@Earth and Water
Flame King@Right, can you believe this nonsense? Once I get outta here, I'm gonna ground you for real. No snacks, no friends, no popular music.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@You never let me have any of those things! You were a selfish king and a bad parent!@Earth and Water
Flame King@But I did it for you, honey—for you not to overthrow me like you just did.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@You belong in that lamp! And if you don't settle down, you'll have to answer to Cinnamon Bun!@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@Hi.@Earth and Water
Finn@Wow. She's even awesomer than I remember.@Earth and Water
Princess Bubblegum@Take off that silly hat. We're going home.@Earth and Water
Cinnamon Bun@No. Look, got a real dog now! Hah.@Earth and Water
Finn@Flame Princess, listen. I'm really sorry I lied and hurt your feelings, and I was a big fat jerk—@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@Finn, it's okay. It's in the past now.@Earth and Water
Finn@So, does that mean we're still going out?@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@No. I've realized my place is here, ruling these weak and vicious Fire People.@Earth and Water
Finn@I see.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@But we're cool. You're welcome to come back and hang out whenever you like if you promise me one thing.@Earth and Water
Finn@Anything.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@That you'll be completely honest with me.@Earth and Water
Finn@Heh. Okay. I promise.@Earth and Water
Flame Princess@I'm serious.@Earth and Water

Finn, Jake, & Ice King@Aah!@Time Sandwich
Finn & Jake@The Ice King? Grr—eh!@Time Sandwich
Ice King@Jeez, you couldn't wait two seconds?@Time Sandwich
Finn@Ech. Why are you stinkin' up our house?@Time Sandwich
Ice King@Didn't you get my text? It said I'm stayin' with you guys— oh, didn't go through. Well, anyways, I knew you wouldn't mind since it's sorta your fault I'm homeless, right?@Time Sandwich
Finn@Right.@Time Sandwich
Ice King@'Cause you tricked your crazy ex into meltin' my Ice Kingdom?@Time Sandwich
Finn@Mmhm.@Time Sandwich
Ice King@With your lies and secrets? 'Member when that happened?@Time Sandwich
Jake@Dude, you can't stay here if you're gonna stank it up with your bad vibes, man!@Time Sandwich
Ice King@Yeah, I'm just crashing here while the penguins rebuild. I've given Gunter temporary reign.@Time Sandwich
Ice King@Should be fine.@Time Sandwich
Finn@Flame Princess isn't crazy.@Time Sandwich
Ice King@You're blind, Finn. You're blind—wait, she isn't here, is she?@Time Sandwich
Finn@No.@Time Sandwich
Ice King@Whew!@Time Sandwich
Finn@She said she wanted time to herself.@Time Sandwich
Ice King@Yeesh.@Time Sandwich
Jake@Yeah, breakups are tough.@Time Sandwich
Ice King@Heh, yeah, like, remember how you and I were married?@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@Uh! It's so confusing!@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@Hmm? I thought Finn was a stand-up guy, you know? But he basically betrayed me.@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@Why do people even have secrets?@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@It's like that in the Fire Kingdom, too. Everyone is all deceitful and Shakespeare. But out here doesn't seem any different. Why do I have to feel like this? And what is that noise?! Grrr!@Time Sandwich
Princess Bubblegum@Eh.@Time Sandwich
Princess Bubblegum@Yeah, yeah. Just act like I'm not here.@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@Are you spying on me?!@Time Sandwich
Princess Bubblegum@What?! No, of course not!@Time Sandwich
Princess Bubblegum@I was observing you—for research. You're a threat, Flame Princess. Your emotions are directly linked to your combustion levels. But if I can create a scientific model that describes your complete elemental matrix, I can isolate and suppress your more... volatile traits.@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@So, if you do your research, you'll know how to cut off my emotions so I won't feel like this?@Time Sandwich
Princess Bubblegum@Umm, yeah, basically!@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@Then I'll help you.@Time Sandwich
Princess Bubblegum@You will?@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@Yes. I'll do whatever it takes.@Time Sandwich
Princess Bubblegum@Once I press this button, you'll be subjected to a battery of tests to gauge your reflexes, stamina, and your reaction to various emotional stimuli.@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@This is going to help me understand myself?@Time Sandwich
Princess Bubblegum@There's a 40% chance we'll be able to identify and isolate your chemical components—and yes, understand you in a very scientific way.@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@Oh. That's good... I guess.@Time Sandwich
Princess Bubblegum@Initiate test. Yah. Hello?@Time Sandwich
Jake@Princess! We need you and your Ball Blam Burglerber right away! Gunter has created a race of strangling snow snakes, or snow-a-constrictors!@Time Sandwich
Jake@Aaaah—@Time Sandwich
Princess Bubblegum@Okay, Cinnamon Bun, all you have to do is write down the numbers that appear on this monitor. Can you do that one thing?@Time Sandwich
Cinnamon Bun@Yes.@Time Sandwich
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, one other thing. Do not open that door. So that's two things write down the numbers, do not open that door. Got it?@Time Sandwich
Cinnamon Bun@Yes, Princess.@Time Sandwich
Cinnamon Bun@Hello.@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@Hello.@Time Sandwich
Cinnamon Bun@You look sad.@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@Yeah, but mostly I'm confused.@Time Sandwich
Cinnamon Bun@Ha, me too.@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@Really?@Time Sandwich
Cinnamon Bun@Yeah. Bubblegum is bad.@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@She is?!@Time Sandwich
Cinnamon Bun@I don't know. Wanna pet my dog?! He lives at my house.@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@What about the tests?@Time Sandwich
Cinnamon Bun@I'm not good at tests.@Time Sandwich
Cinnamon Bun@La-de-da-de-da His name is Jake, but he's not the real Jake. Ow. My body is soft.@Time Sandwich
Cinnamon Bun@We're friends.@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@Yeah, I really get you, but sometimes friends are hard to understand. Sometimes you think you know them, but you find out they're just playing mind games.@Time Sandwich
Cinnamon Bun@Is the princess your friend?@Time Sandwich
Flame Princess@I don't know.@Time Sandwich
Cinnamon Bun@Yeah, because why did she lock you up in jail when you were a little baby? That was a weird friend thing.@Time Sandwich
Messenger@The word! The word!@Time Sandwich

Boss@I might could, but it's a top-shelf shakedown. Know what I'm saying?@The Vault
Shoko@I can step to that.@The Vault
Boss@There's a rival camp down river. The leader's got some magic omelette, you know? Mmm. You know? The kind you wear around your neck.@The Vault
Shoko@I think it's pronounced "amulet."@The Vault
Boss@Oh, don't get fresh with me, girlie. I talk good. Anyway, when I get my hands on that omelet, whoo-hoo! Forget about everything, baby. I'll be the biggest cheese in creation.@The Vault

Boss@Shake on it.@The Vault
Boss@You pull this off, and I'll let you join my gang.@The Vault

Princess Bubblegum@So, who knocked you out?@The Vault
Shoko@Bath Boy Gang.@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@Ugh! I hate those boys!@The Vault
Shoko@Yeah, they stole everything I had, but that's okay. My parents always told me that simple possessions aren't the most important things in life.@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@Word 'em up.@The Vault
Shoko@They told me "all you really need is a good computer."@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@Amen. Wait, what?!@The Vault
Shoko@They traded my arm to some tranch for a computer.@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@They what?!@The Vault
Shoko@What?@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@Parents should protect their children!@The Vault
Shoko@What? Really?@The Vault
Shoko@Do you have any kids?@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@All the Candy People are like my children, except young Mr. Cream Puff... he's like my boyfriend. Anyway, protecting my people is the most important thing to me. That's why I've got to take down the Bath Boy Gang.@The Vault

Bath Boy@I'm spyin' on you. Wait 'til I tell boss that you quit the life for a cruddy day job!@The Vault
Shoko@I'm gaining her trust, you momo. Say... you can help me.@The Vault
Bath Boy@Huh?@The Vault
Shoko@Stay away from me you gang boy! Ahhhhh!@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@A Bath Boy!@The Vault
Bath Boy@What're you doing?!@The Vault
Shoko@Be cool!@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@That was bananamas! Where'd you learn to fight like that?@The Vault

Princess Bubblegum@That's it! There's just one last step.@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@Hello.@The Vault
Gumball Guardians@Hello, mother!@The Vault

Princess Bubblegum@Hey, guess what, thanks for helping me make those guys.@The Vault
Shoko@I like feeling handy.@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@I want to repay you for your help.@The Vault
Shoko@Oh, yeah? You gonna give me that amulet, maybe?@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@No. No, dude, I made you a thing.@The Vault
Princess Bubblegun@That's it. You can do it.@The Vault
Shoko@You made me a man servant?@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@No! In the box.@The Vault
Shoko@Oh, no...@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@What do you mean "Oh, no"? I made you an arm! It's a dang plug 'n' play, girl.@The Vault
Shoko@No, it's awesome... I can't believe it.@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@That's right, I'm a technical wonder-child.@The Vault
Shoko@Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, I gotta go to my room for no reason.@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@Okay! I thought we could do some two-arm stuff, but... uh, it's cool!@The Vault
Bath Boy Gang Leader@Pretend my finger's a knife.@The Vault
Shoko@I'm sorry, Princess Bubblegum...@The Vault
Gumball Guardian@Are you okay, princess?@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@Ah, jeez, you're so loud!@The Vault
Gumball Guardian@Are you in danger?@The Vault
Princess Bubblegum@No! Don't just guard me! You need to protect everyone!@The Vault
Gumball Guardian@Okay.@The Vault

Jake@If I hear another peep, there's gonna be trouble! Final warning. Okay, go ahead, BMO.@Love Games
Jake@Okay, welcome back to the program. We're talkin' with our special guest, Finn the Human.@Love Games
Finn@Hello.@Love Games
Jake@Now, Finn, before the break, you were sayin' somethin' interesting—that you're gettin' outta the romance biz. So, what happened?@Love Games
Finn@Well, I don't want to bore your listeners...@Love Games
Finn@But let's just say the time has come to stop dating princesses... and return to savin' 'em.@Love Games
Jake@And you're not just sayin' that to, uh— make yourself seem more attractive?@Love Games
Finn@Yeah, of course. No games goin' on here.@Love Games
Jake@Hold on, hold on. What's that noise?@Love Games
BMO@I think someone's knocking at the door.@Love Games
Jake@Can you see who it is?@Love Games
BMO@Yes, Jake.@Love Games
Jake@So, it's goin' pretty good, huh?@Love Games
Finn@Yeah, but maybe we should stop talking about this "love" junk and get back to adventuring.@Love Games
Slime Princess@Finn! Jake! I need your help; it's an emergency!@Love Games
Finn@Now we're talkin'! Don't cry, Slime Princess. We're at your service.@Love Games
Slime Princess@I need Finn to marry me.@Love Games
Finn@I'm sorry, SP, but I've given up the dating scene.@Love Games
Slime Princess@You don't understand. If I don't get a husband, I'll lose my kingdom.@Love Games
Ice King@I'll do it!@Love Games
Jake@What did I tell you?!@Love Games
Slime Princess@Please let me explain.@Love Games
Slime Princess@Recently, my much hotter younger sister, Blargetha, married a Slime rogue named Guillermo. As a result, Elder Plops decreed that if I was not married by tomorrow, rule of the Slime Kingdom would pass to my sister...@Love Games
Slime Princess@...which I'd be, like, totally fine with...@Love Games
Slime Princess@Except, I recently discovered they are both evil. Evil to the core! They plan to militarize the kingdom and begin a campaign of aggressive conquest, sacking our neighboring kingdoms, stealing their resources, and eventually taking over the entire world!@Love Games
Jake@Ew.@Love Games
Slime Princess@Finn, this will happen unless someone marries me.@Love Games
Finn@No.@Love Games
Ice King@Psst!@Love Games
Jake@Hmm!@Love Games
Slime Princess@Please, Finn. I know I've crushed on you in the past, but I have no intention of locking this down. Our marriage will be in name only.@Love Games
Finn@Hmmm...@Love Games
Jake@Wait, I'm coming, too! I'm gonna eat popcorn and make hilarious jokes. Aw, who ate all my popcorn?@Love Games
Ice King@You call this a room? There's not even a window. Oh, wait. Are we rolling?@Love Games
Jake@How much farther? This popcorn's not gonna last all day. Alright, now it might.@Love Games
Slime Princess@We're here. Welcome to my little oasis in the wasteland.@Love Games
Jake@Oasis? More like, "No way, sis!" @Love Games
Finn@Huh?@Love Games
Finn@Whoa! This is amazing! You okay, buddy?@Love Games
Jake@You could say I got out of there in the "lick" of time. Zing!@Love Games
Slime Princess@Quickly. We're already late. This is the most important place in the kingdom.@Love Games
Finn@The royal palace?@Love Games
Slime Princess@No, it's where me and all my main splurts hang out. Hi, girls!@Love Games
Slime People@Hi!@Love Games
Finn@Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig, what are you doing here?@Love Games
Tree Trunks@Oh, we always come here when we want to shake it, Finn. It's the only triple cray-rated disco in all of Ooo.@Love Games
Slime Princess@Get your face pretty, Finn. My people are already assembled in the courtyard. Greetings, loyal slimejects!@Love Games
Slime Princess@I would like to introduce my new husband, Finn the Human!@Love Games
Slime Princess@What did I tell you? Piece of cake.@Love Games
Blargetha@Attention, my loyal slimejects!@Love Games
Slime Princess@It's Blargetha. And that's the mysterious Guillermo. He hails from a faraway, much more somber Slime Kingdom where people have strange customs and no love in their eyes. Their discos aren't even rated one cray.@Love Games
Blargetha@My husband would like to say something. And, uh, he would, too, if not for his extremely sore throat. So I will say it for him. We challenge you to the Trials of Glarb.@Love Games
Slime Princess@I object! Ancient traditions such as the Trials of Glarb are no longer relevant in our modern self-indulgent society.@Love Games
Elder Plops@Order, order! I demand order. I, Elder Plops, being the coolest guy in the room, will settle this dispute. The matter will be settled on the battleground...@Love Games
Finn@Alright!@Love Games
Elder Plops@...the battleground of love.@Love Games
Finn@Aw.@Love Games
Elder Plops@The couple that I deem most truly in love shall rule the Slime Kingdom for life. Plops out.@Love Games
Jake@This is, like, the opposite of what you wanted.@Love Games
Elder Plops@Welcome to the Trials of Glarb, hosted by me, Elder Plops. The first trial will be Crooning. You guys are gonna get into these sweet boats I made and croon for each other on the lake. The most loving and heartfelt song, judged by me, Elder Plops, will win.@Love Games
Elder Plops@I really want to hear some emotional song work here. The people want to hear emotional stuff. So let's see some stuff, alright?@Love Games
Slime Princess@Okay, Finn, you can do it.@Love Games
Finn@I don't know. I'm still jacked up over my lady biz.@Love Games
Slime Princess@Well, just lose yourself in your own mind and go numb. Then let it all out.@Love Games
Finn@Eh. Okay. Just let it all out. Why can't I get over you?@Love Games
Elder Plops@Finn, way to go. I could tell the people were really impressed. Guillermo, you're up.@Love Games
Blargetha@Hmm? Okay, Guillermo. I'll ask, I'll ask. Uh, Guillermo still has a sore throat! Uh, may I sing on, uh, his behalf?@Love Games
Elder Plops@Elder Plops thinks that's okay.@Love Games
Blargetha@♪I want to touch your hand with my hand. I want to rub your cheek with my cheek. Maybe later we can get "Do not disturb."♪ I'm done!@Love Games
Elder Plops@As Elder Plops, I have heard many songs in my life, and I can only say this... Finn, you win this one.@Love Games
Slime People@Hooray!@Love Games
Finn@Whoo!@Love Games
Slime Princess@Yes!@Love Games
Elder Plops@Welcome, everyone, to our second trial... Spooning. When I say go, the big spoon will put his arm around the little spoon and cuddle. I will be watching you spoon, measuring and assessing your love by posture and overall vibe. The best cuddle, or spoon, wins.@Love Games
Finn@Wait, what?!@Love Games
Elder Plops@Spooners, get in your futons.@Love Games
Finn@Uh, I don't feel good about this.@Love Games
Elder Plops@Ready, set...@Love Games
Elder Plops@Spoon!@Love Games
Finn@No, wait. I don't wanna do this.@Love Games
Slime Princess@Wrap those gorgeous pythons around me!@Love Games
Finn@No! This feels weird!@Love Games
Slime Princess@Come on, Finn, they're crushing us!@Love Games
Blargetha@Huh! Huh! Huh!@Love Games
Elder Plops@Blargetha and Guillermo, very nice.@Love Games
Finn@Nooooooooooooooooo!@Love Games
Elder Plops@Yeesh. Alright, everyone, stop. I've seen enough. Blargetha and Guillermo's love was way-off-the-charts good. They win.@Love Games
Blargetha@Yes! I love you, baby. You spoon so good!@Love Games
Slime Princess@No!@Love Games
Elder Plops@The score is tied. There's one more trial after Spooning and Crooning Smooching. I'm sorry it doesn't rhyme with Crooning and Spooning. We will begin our next trial on the morrow!@Love Games
Slime Princess@This is not going well.@Love Games
Finn@I'm sorry, Slime Princess. I'm just gonna mess this next trial up.@Love Games
Slime Princess@Is it because you haven't done much kissing? You don't have to be embarrassed by your innocence.@Love Games
Finn@Pretending to be in love is making me sad. It makes me think about Flame Princess.@Love Games
Slime Princess@What If I pretend to be your ex?@Love Games
Finn@That's worse, I think.@Love Games
Slime Princess@Well, it looks like I'm losing my kingdom to the forces of evil.@Love Games
Finn@No, Slime Princess. Let's practice this smooch.@Love Games
Slime Princess@Mmmm.@Love Games
Finn@I'm sorry. I—I can't! Bunk this.@Love Games
Slime Princess@Wait! Where are you going?@Love Games
Finn@I'm going to punch Guillermo in his stupid face until he agrees to leave the kingdom.@Love Games
Slime Princess@I want to come!@Love Games
Finn@Hey, Guillermo! Can you come out here for a... quick meeting?@Love Games
Jake@More like a quick beating! Hey-oh!@Love Games
Blargetha@He says "Eat a fat dollop and buzz off!"@Love Games
Slime Princess@Blargetha!@Love Games
Finn@Hyup! Hmm.@Love Games
Blargetha@Finn, you shouldn't break in to a woman's room.@Love Games
Finn@Hyah! Everyone okay?@Love Games
Jake@Yes. "Tank" you.@Love Games
Finn@Huah!@Love Games
Blargetha@Huh?@Love Games
Finn@Guillermo! Hyuh! Are you dead, man? Aw, jeez, bro. Huh? These are olives.@Love Games
Blargetha@Uh-oh.@Love Games
Slime Princess@Blargetha, why would you make a fake husband? You're so hot.@Love Games
Blargetha@You don't know how hard it is to be this hot. Women don't want to talk to you, because they're intimidated, and guys don't want to talk to you, because they're too scared. You're alone in the hottest, most sexiest prison. So I stuck some olives in a glob of gelatin and called it my lover.@Love Games
Finn@Well, I'm sorry, Blargetha, but you're going to have to spend more time in your metaphorical prison in a real prison 'cause what you're doing is illegal.@Love Games
Slime Princess@Uh, no, it just disqualifies her from challenging me.@Love Games
Finn@Whoops.@Love Games
Elder Plops@By the authority of Elder Plops, I officially declare... you are still the Slime princess.@Love Games
Slime People@Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!@Love Games
Slime Princess@Finn, what do you think?@Love Games
Finn@I don't want to disappoint all these people.@Love Games
Slime Princess@I'm sorry! I can't do it!@Love Games
Finn@What... is the meaning of "soup"?@Dungeon Train
Jake@What? I don't know. What's with all the weird quest—?@Dungeon Train
Finn@What... is the meaning of "spoon"?@Dungeon Train
Jake@Shoot, man, are you still lady-sad about Flame Princess? Y'know, it's okay if you are.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Naw, that's all fine. I just been feeling kind of... gray, is all. Like my inside voice has been kinda quiet lately. Not a lot of instructions forthcoming, y'know?@Dungeon Train
Jake@Yeah, well, sounds like you're sad. Listen, Finn, girls is like horses. When you fall down, it's important that you get right back on again—on a different horse. And there's a lot of fish in the sea. A lot of fish. A penny saved is a penny earned.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Yeah, I-I guess. Or maybe dating girls is like riding a bicycle.@Dungeon Train
Jake@Yeah, man, yeah!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Or, like, if you mess up, you could get really hurt forever, or hurt someone you really care about.@Dungeon Train
Jake@Eh, well, I suppose. Anyway, I hope this mystery cave we're looking for is as weird as Flambo's brother says it is. Maybe that'll snap you out of the— Whoa! What?!@Dungeon Train
Jake@What's this train all about? No one said nothing about no train in the way!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Relax, buddy. We'll just cross after it passes. No big thing, really.@Dungeon Train
Jake@Oh, yeah.@Dungeon Train
Jake@It's two hours later now. What the stunk? Oh, okay. Hey, the train just goes in a big circle! We can cut right through the middle, blingle, blongle, blungle! Come on! Wha-hey! You know, I just had another idea! If we just stay put here on the train, we could ride it all the way to the cave. Blingle, blongle, blungle!@Dungeon Train
Creature@Gimme! Gimme the loot!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Ow!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Yeeow!@Dungeon Train
Creature@Gimme! Gimme that hat!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Knock it off!@Dungeon Train
Creature@Aah!@Dungeon Train
Creature@Oh, dang!@Dungeon Train
Jake@Hey, Finn!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Whoa!@Dungeon Train
Jake@Look at all the loot that guy dropped while you whipped his butt!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Dang, look at that sword! Whoa. Feels kinda right. Whoosh. Whoosh. Vvsh, vvsh. Whoa!@Dungeon Train
Jake@Pretty fun, huh?@Dungeon Train
Finn@Yeah, man! It's spicy baby fun!@Dungeon Train
Jake@You wanna go see what other kind of monsters are on this train?@Dungeon Train
Finn@Yes!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Whoa, Crystal Ants, I think!@Dungeon Train
Jake@Cool!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Ha-ha! Yeah! Die, die, die, die, die, die, die!@Dungeon Train
Jake@Welcome back, buddy.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Man, look at all this rad loot!@Dungeon Train
Jake@Yeah, this is a pretty neat train. We should come back again someday.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Whoa, what do you mean? We just started only, like, three hours ago.@Dungeon Train
Jake@Heheh, yeah. I'm just gettin' a little bored, is all. All these cars of monsters are kinda all the same. It's a little boring.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Oh, come on. It's fun! Just one more car. Come on. Come on, man! Come on!@Dungeon Train
Jake@All right, just one more.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Ha-ha, yes!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Hmm? Where is everybody?@Dungeon Train
Jake@Hey, hey! Empty car—think we beat it, buddy.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Whoa, man! Boss battle! Let's chew it up!@Dungeon Train
Jake@Okay, but this is the last one, okay?@Dungeon Train
Finn@We'll see!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Ha-ha!@Dungeon Train
Jake@Hey, man, you remember we were going to that weird cave? Bet it's not too late to check it out.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Eh, weird cave, weird train—I'm cool here.@Dungeon Train
Jake@Okay.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Hyah!@Dungeon Train
Head@Ahhhh, gimme a break!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Oh? Oh, dang. Boss loot! Oh, yeah.@Dungeon Train
Jake@No, thank you.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Jake, hurry. Next car!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Slime crimes!@Dungeon Train
Jake@You have fun. I'm just gonna watch.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Hey.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Ow! Ow. Cool... acid!@Dungeon Train
Jake@Hey, also, man, aren't you, like, gettin' kinda hungry?@Dungeon Train
Finn@Yeah, man. I guess we've been here for a while.@Dungeon Train
Jake@More than a while, dude. I've already missed my bathroom window!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Yeah, I guess I could take a snack break.@Dungeon Train
Jake@'Kay! Well, we'll go back to the tree house, and I'll make us some lunch. I could make the toaster pancakes you like.@Dungeon Train
Jake@And maybe I can boil up some hot dogs, or—@Dungeon Train
Finn@Look. Now we don't gotta do that thing you wanted to do.@Dungeon Train
Jake@Aah!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Hot meat!@Dungeon Train
Jake@Ants again?@Dungeon Train
Finn@"Ant" no thang! Yah! Caught with your "ants" down! "Ants" for nothin'! Forget about "ant"! What's wrong? Feeling antsy? @Dungeon Train
Jake@Dude, this is the ant car. We already did the ant car. We did all the ants!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Same car, but those were blue ants. These are red ants.@Dungeon Train
Jake@Finn, I think we should take off. I think this place is bad news for you.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Man, no way. All this feels good. Like my inside voice is saying, "Hey, keep it up. This is good stuff." Aah! Hey! Ah! Like when you made those biscuits way back? And I kept eating them until they were all gone. Like that!@Dungeon Train
Jake@Finn, I made those biscuits with so much butter. You were just responding to the butter! This whole place is butter!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Yeah!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Boss fight!@Dungeon Train
Boss@My jacket-sta!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Check it out battle moon.@Dungeon Train
Jake@What? Finn! This is a future crystal! Look!@Dungeon Train
Jake@That's you, dude! You're old, you're alone, and you're still fighting on this dumb train!@Dungeon Train
Future Finn@Get "ant" of town.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Whoa. I'm gonna have the best life!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Oh, Hair Apes!@Dungeon Train
Jake@Nuh-uh, dude. I'm bored, I'm tired, and I'm goin' back to the tree house. You can come with me if you want.@Dungeon Train
Finn@What? No, man! It's better on the train; stuff makes sense here.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Yow!@Dungeon Train
Jake@I'm sorry. If you wish to join me, I'll be in the tree house experiencing the joys of life and not getting attacked by gorillas made out of hair.@Dungeon Train
Finn@You'll be back.@Dungeon Train
Jake@No, I won't, Finn. Goodbye!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Hey! "Hair" we go!@Dungeon Train
Jake@What're you doin' up here?@Dungeon Train
Jake@Are you gettin' sick of things down there, too?@Dungeon Train
Jake@Mm-hmm.@Dungeon Train
Jake@You're not gonna try and zap me, are you?@Dungeon Train
Jake@I wonder what my kids are doin'.@Dungeon Train
Jake@Hey! I knew it!@Dungeon Train
Jake@Gotta find that kid. Hey, Finn! Fi—oh! Umm... hey, there, friend. I ain't lookin' for no trouble. Just lookin' for my friend, Finn. Maybe you seen him? About five feet tall, picks his nose, and always kinda smells funny l—@Dungeon Train
Finn@Hey, hey! Jake, it's me! I'm just all souped up now.@Dungeon Train
Jake@Ah, jeez, Finn. I... for a minute there, I thought you were one of those twisted-lost-soul boss guys.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl.@Dungeon Train
Jake@Wait, you are! You are one!@Dungeon Train
Finn@What? Those guys are cool!@Dungeon Train
Jake@That's it, man! I'm gettin' you off this train whether you like it or not!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Jake, stay back. I mean it!@Dungeon Train
Jake@Oh, please. What're you gonna do? I'm ten times stronger than—@Dungeon Train
Jake@Ah, gross!@Dungeon Train
Finn@Yoink! Pff, Jake—tryin' to tell me what to do. Pff, yeah, right. I tells me what to do. Now let's see what we got here. Apple, apple, chicken, apple... Oh, yeah, that little orb in which I rule! Let's see that again, orb. Yeah, that's right. Lookin' right. Wait a second, who's that sad ward little guy followin' me around? Jake? All those years—he stayed with me.@Dungeon Train
Future Jake@Finn, can we slow down? My feet hurt.@Dungeon Train
Future Finn@What?@Dungeon Train
Finn@Oh, Jake. Hang in there, buddy. I'ma set this right.@Dungeon Train
Jake@Finn? Finn, I'm sorry. I'll stay on the train with you, I swear. Just get this stuff off of me.@Dungeon Train
Finn@No, I'm sorry, Jake. I messed up, but don't worry. It's all over now.@Dungeon Train
Jake@You mean we're gettin' off the train?@Dungeon Train
Finn@Well... you are. I'm gonna keep playin' for a while. I'll meet you back home in a week or two.@Dungeon Train
Jake@Aw, man, don't you see that's just the train talkin'? It's got its hooks in you!@Dungeon Train
Finn@No, no for real! My inside is tellin' me it's time. Here, see for yourself.@Dungeon Train
Jake@Yeah, man. That's what I'm talkin' about. That... is what I'm talkin' about.@Dungeon Train
Finn@Aw, yes. Storm has passed! Jake! Jake...@Box Prince
Jake@Nachos?@Box Prince
Finn@Nachos? I love nachos... I love nachos even more when looking out of the window!@Box Prince
Finn@Hmmm, does that box have a face on it? A face... I gotta make sure.@Box Prince
Finn@There's a box outside with a face on it! It might be the boxman, it's all soggy and dirty. Want to check it out?@Box Prince
Jake@Naaaaa... chos.@Box Prince
Finn@I'm gonna check it out.@Box Prince
Jake@Yeah, whatever.@Box Prince
Finn@Hmmm, where'd your face go?@Box Prince
Finn@Whoa! Okay... shhh... are you lost, little cardboard dude?@Box Prince
Finn@Jake! There seems to be a lost cat on the ground in a box!@Box Prince
Jake@Yeah that's great, get it out of here!@Box Prince
Finn@Hm, gettin' no help from him I guess. Do you know where your home is?@Box Prince
Finn@Okay, I'll follow you!@Box Prince
Finn@Whoa, is this your kingdom? It's wonderful!@Box Prince
Finn@That must be your prince.@Box Prince
Finn@Huh?@Box Prince
Finn@Huh... a prince wouldn't steal from his subjects. Awww!@Box Prince
Finn@Switched? Of course! You must be the real prince, and that thief took your place! Is that right, little prince?@Box Prince
Finn@Don't worry, your majesty. I'll help you reclaim your kingdom.@Box Prince
BMO@Why do you hate cats, Jake?@Box Prince
Jake@Move your face, you're messing up the game. Anyway, I don't wanna talk about it, it's personal. Cats know what they did...@Box Prince
BMO@Is Jake okay?@Box Prince
Jake@Eugh... no! I'm pretty dang far from okay! There's a little shard of Tortilla chip caught between my teeth.@Box Prince
Finn@First, we have to expose the traitor's deception. Ah-hah! That's a counterfeit crown, from the liar's own box flesh. Hmm... it looks like your crown was torn off by some...@Box Prince
Box Prince@Mew.@Box Prince
Finn@Your crown was lost, you say?@Box Prince
Finn@During a storm? The same storm that sent you hurling through the woods? Until you were delivered into my door step? Right... so it's definitely in the woods somewhere. All we have to do is find your crown to prove to your people that you're the real prince.@Box Prince
Finn@Um... I'm gonna wait over by the gate, your highness.@Box Prince
BMO@Get big, and the chip will fall out of your teeth!@Box Prince
Jake@You think I can stretch out of everything? You're so naïve. To live life, you need problems.@Box Prince
BMO@That's stupid!@Box Prince
Jake@If you get everything you want the minute you want it, then what's the point of livin'?@Box Prince
Finn@Okay, so let's retrace your steps. Do you remember which path you took? ... Prince?@Box Prince
Finn@Whoa, you found it already! Good work, team.@Box Prince
Finn@Ow, quit that! Come on, you're a prince. Come, your majesty. It's time...@Box Prince
Finn@People of the Box Kingdom, I have found... your true prince! J'accuse!@Box Prince
Finn@What? They... they don't believe us. The rain made your complexion look all hobo-like. They're not looking past the surface grunk.@Box Prince
Finn@Oh no, he's challenging you to a joust! I better find you a lance.@Box Prince
BMO@Did it come out?@Box Prince
Jake@You forgot the most important part, my impatient little friend. A thorough rinsing!@Box Prince
BMO@Well?@Box Prince
Jake@Bleh, nothing. I need, like, a toothpick, or something.@Box Prince
BMO@I told you to buy floss.@Box Prince
Jake@Floss is for losers.@Box Prince
Jake@Oh, one of these will do nicely.@Box Prince
BMO@You'll put cards in your mouth?!@Box Prince
Jake@Just the edge, kid, then I'll work it like a pro. Now, to find the card that best suits my devil-may-care personality.@Box Prince
Finn@Trial by combat shall prove which prince's true!@Box Prince
Finn@The joust's gone nuts!@Box Prince
Jake@Hey, BMO! TA DA!@Box Prince
BMO@You did it, Jake! Congratulations! How did you get the piece of tortilla chip out of your teeth?@Box Prince
Jake@Oh, I didn't. It's still there. It'll be like a constant reminder of what life's all about.@Box Prince
BMO@... This is unsatisfying!@Box Prince
Jake@ZIP IT!@Box Prince
Finn@Bad! Bad princes!@Box Prince
Finn@Which is which...?@Box Prince
Finn@Awwww! This is the one! This is your prince!@Box Prince
Finn@Or maybe this is the one!@Box Prince
Finn@Hmmm, is this... is this even a kingdom?@Box Prince
Finn@Haha! Hey! Ow, you guys... aw, come on!@Box Prince
Finn@What's wrong with you, man?@Red Starved
Jake@I ate all the candy in your backpack, and now I'm sick.@Red Starved
Finn@I didn't bring any candy.@Red Starved
Jake@Oh, no. That explains why it didn't taste right.@Red Starved
Finn@Nothing tastes right today. Like, I thought we were going to get into some serious flavor with these sand people, but they're just standing around like garnish.@Red Starved
Jake@That's how I feel—like a dying parsley. So what's goin' on with the spoon? Marceline and the spoon.@Red Starved
Finn@Um... nothing. Wait, there she goes!@Red Starved
Marceline@Yo, wake up, sand dude. I think they're dead. A spoon.@Red Starved
Finn@Yea-uh. The Spoon of Prosperity!@Red Starved
Jake@It doesn't look like mu—@Red Starved
Jake@Oh, my gosh, I feel so much better! Hungry, even. Guys, let's go home!@Red Starved
Finn@We've gotta get this spoon to Princess Bubblegum first.@Red Starved
Jake@♪Let's rock!♪@Red Starved
Marceline@What's PB want with that spoon, anyway?@Red Starved
Finn@Beats me.@Red Starved
Jake@Sometimes it's better not to know.@Red Starved
Marceline@Yeah, I guess that's true with Bonnibel.@Red Starved
Jake@Hey, guys, look what I found!@Red Starved
Marceline@Is that quicksand?@Red Starved
Jake@Yeah! Heh. Quicksand is pretty fun. Heh.@Red Starved
Finn@Quit messing around, Jake.@Red Starved
Jake@Okie-doke.@Red Starved
Finn@Whoa!@Red Starved
Jake@Hmm. Hey, is this whole place made out of sand?@Red Starved
Marceline@Sure looks that way.@Red Starved
Jake@Uh, give me a pull, please. Stop, you guys are tickling me! Let me try this other thing. Flesh drill!@Red Starved
Finn@I'm not sure that's a good idea—@Red Starved
Jake@Yaah! Rug burn! Ow! Ow!@Red Starved
Jake@Aah! Whoo! It worked! Jake drill worked, you guys.@Red Starved
Finn@Whoa!@Red Starved
Jake@Check it out! My piggies are free.@Red Starved
Marceline@You just demolished half the underground city!@Red Starved
Jake@Yeah, only half.@Red Starved
Finn@You also sealed our exit.@Red Starved
Jake@Our only exit.@Red Starved
Jake@No regre-e-e-ets! I'm sorry. This little piggie stayed home, and so should have I. I know! I'll dig us out of here.@Red Starved
Finn & Marceline@No!@Red Starved
Finn@You'll bury us alive!@Red Starved
Marceline@Undead!@Red Starved
Finn@Finn to PB. Come in, PB.@Red Starved
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, hi, Finn.@Red Starved
Finn@Princess, we're trapped in the underground city.@Red Starved
Princess Bubblegum@Yeah-yeah. That sounds great.@Red Starved
Finn@Huh? No, we need help!@Red Starved
Princess Bubblegum@That's great! Gre-gre-great! Great, great!@Red Starved
Finn@Guess we lost the signal.@Red Starved
Marceline@Any more bright ideas?@Red Starved
Jake@Snacks!@Red Starved
Marceline@How are snacks gonna get us out of here?@Red Starved
Jake@I wanna eat snacks... because I am hungry.@Red Starved
Marceline@I'm hungry, too. Bust the snacks, Finn.@Red Starved
Jake@Bust, bust, bust!@Red Starved
Marceline@Hey, where are my red erasers? They were in here.@Red Starved
Jake@Uh-oh. I thought they were candy.@Red Starved
Marceline@You... ate all... MY RED?!?!@Red Starved
Jake@Oooh. I'm sorry!@Red Starved
Finn@Calm down, Marceline. There's gotta be some red stuff in these ruins. I'll go explore. You guys hang out here and save your energy.@Red Starved
Marceline@Thanks, Finn.@Red Starved
Finn@Be cool.@Red Starved
Jake@So how hungry are you?@Red Starved
Jake@Aah! I'm sorry. Please don't eat my blood!@Red Starved
Marceline@Jake, I don't want to hurt you, but you should know things get crazy when I'm hungry.@Red Starved
Jake@Like... how crazy?@Red Starved
Marceline@I'm gonna go into feral mode. It's not gonna be pretty.@Red Starved
Marceline@I know. Let's tie me up. That way, you won't be scared.@Red Starved
Jake@And that will keep you from draining my bloods?@Red Starved
Marceline@Not physically, no, but as a prop, I think it'll be good for both of us. You know, psychologically.@Red Starved
Jake@Hurry, Finn.@Red Starved
Finn@Red, red, red. I guess even a vampire queen's face would melt off if she tried to eat lava.@Red Starved
Marceline@Get me a bucket of lava, Jake.@Red Starved
Jake@Yo, you know better than that.@Red Starved
Marceline@Do iiiit...@Red Starved
Jake@Don't go crazy, okay?@Red Starved
Marceline@I'm frickin' hungry.@Red Starved
Jake@Why did you leave me here, dude?@Red Starved
Finn@Okay, here we go. Yeah, look at that! Something crazy red behind this door. Hmm. Why are y'all holding this door shut? You don't look like sand peeps, neither. More like wisemen-zerts . Oh, well. Gotta feed the Marcy monster. 'Scuse me. Up, sorry. Okay. Uhh... hi-yah! Oh, dag.@Red Starved
Finn@Cool... What the heck happened here? Whoop! Ew. Whoops. Y'alls got turned into sand people. Don't go in the light. Go like this. Around it. Next time, you guys. Hmm... Whatever's down there's gotta have red blasting out of every hole. Hey, you're not still alive, right?@Red Starved
Finn@Okay. I was just making sure. Bet that guy was a creep. This hole is deep.@Red Starved
Jake@Oh, my Glob. Oh, my Glob, where are you, man? Marcy's wiggin' out!@Red Starved
Marceline@Jaaaake...@Red Starved
Jake@What?@Red Starved
Marceline@I can smell your insides, Jake. They smell... red!@Red Starved
Marceline@Yeah, lemme see in there.@Red Starved
Marceline@Oh, yeah.@Red Starved
Finn@Maybe I should go back. Well, I've already gone this far. Shebang! That oughtta be enough red to un... Oops.@Red Starved
Crab Demon@Paris? Is that you?@Red Starved
Finn@You mean the guy with the big thing on his head?@Red Starved
Crab Demon@Yes. Have you returned to complete the plan?@Red Starved
Finn@Naw. Paris is, like, super dead.@Red Starved
Crab Demon@What?! No! How long?@Red Starved
Finn@Dude, like, a really long time. Like five hundred years.@Red Starved
Crab Demon@Five hundred— Chum! I must've zoned out!@Red Starved
Finn@What the heck were you two doing?@Red Starved
Crab Demon@Once we turned the city to sand, we were gonna reanimate their bodies and conquer my homeland at the center of the planet.@Red Starved
Finn@Hm, that's dumb.@Red Starved
Crab Demon@Time to go back home a true loser.@Red Starved
Finn@Can I have this big ol' ruby, then?@Red Starved
Crab Demon@That's an emerald.@Red Starved

Jake@Okay, all done now. Nice and snug, right?@Red Starved
Marceline@Jake...@Red Starved
Jake@What?@Red Starved
Marceline@I won't be able to... to control myself much longer. I can feel the feeding frenzy coming on. I just wanna let you know I'm sorry.@Red Starved
Jake@You're sick!@Red Starved
Marceline@Yeah...@Red Starved
Jake@C'mon, Jake, think... It's no good! I need brain food. Oh, dang, I ate everything! I'm so hungry! Baby's gonna starve to death! Unless...@Red Starved
Marceline@What?@Red Starved
Marceline@What are you doing?@Red Starved
Jake@I'm cooking up a crazy vampire! That should heat up nice! The sand will keep the meat moist.@Red Starved
Marceline@You're gonna eat me?@Red Starved
Jake@You was gonna eat me!@Red Starved
Marceline@Yes, I am.@Red Starved
Jake@Cook, baby, cook!@Red Starved
Jake@Finn!@Red Starved

Jake@That's an emerald, dude.@Red Starved
Finn@You too now?! Emeralds are green, boyee.@Red Starved
Jake@This thing is green.@Red Starved
Finn@Why is everybody messin' with me? It's like a dark gray-ish red. Mostly gray. Sometimes red things are gray!@Red Starved
Jake@You're a little colorblind... and there's nothin' to be ashamed of!@Red Starved
Finn@Oh... whoops.@Red Starved
Jake@I'm sorry you had to push that thing so far.@Red Starved
Finn@Uh, what's goin' on with Marcy?@Red Starved
Jake@She was threatening to eat my insides, so I'm cooking her. I know that sounds crazy, but I had no choice.@Red Starved
Jake@I'm operating on my lowest survival brain function right now. What?@Red Starved
Finn@Chill, man!@Red Starved
Jake@No, we gotta book! Go!@Red Starved
Marceline@Go where, Jake? I gotta suck out your insides first, right?@Red Starved
Finn@Nay-nay, brah!@Red Starved
Marceline@Time to eat! Huh? What the—?@Red Starved
Finn@Bubblegum?@Red Starved
Princess Bubblegum@Hey, guys. I saw my seismograph had gone off the charts, so I figured you might be in trouble, right?@Red Starved
Jake@Yeah, but watch out for Marceline. She's gone rabid!@Red Starved
Princess Bubblegum@What? Marceline's gonna rap for me?@Red Starved
Marceline@Woof. Thanks, Bonnie. That's enough low-grade red to get me home, at least. Come on, guys. Let's go.@Red Starved
Finn@Are you alright, PB?@Red Starved
Princess Bubblegum@Did you get the Spoon of Prosperity?@Red Starved
Finn@Yeah, here you go.@Red Starved
Finn, Jake, & Marceline@Whoa.@Red Starved
Princess Bubblegum@Peeps will never starve in my eternal empire. Sand worm, up!@Red Starved
Finn@JAKE, WAKE UP! I FOUND A TRUCK!@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@What?@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@What's happening?@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@Whoa! Where did ya get this baby?@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@I found it in the woods. I named it "Hot Daniel." Anyway, I figured we could do some pretty sick stuff with it.@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@Oh, yeah? Like what?@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Hmm. I don't know. Launch it off some ramps, maybe get it going thirty miles per hour, crank the wheel into a gnar right-hander, spray dirt everywhere like a big hurkin' dirt wave?@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@Yeah, buddy! Nice! Let's crank this beast up.@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Can't—engine's busted, I think.@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@Nuts. BMO, you know anything about cars?@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@Nope.@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Hmm. Maybe... Ice King, you know anything about cars?@We Fixed a Truck
Ice King@Nope. Not a car guy—too confusing. Got better things to do with my life.@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Hmm.@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@Wait... I know someone who's good with mechanics.@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@Hey! Hey, guys! Hi!@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@Hey, Banana Man.@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@Wow! I haven't seen you fellas since you destroyed my home, my land, and my rocket.@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Aw, jeez, yeah. Sorry, Banana Man—just sorta happened.@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@Don't worry about it! Feh! Bygones! I'm just excited you called me over. We're neighbors. We should help each other out. I got the soda and the jams.@We Fixed a Truck
Finn, Jake, & BMO@Cool!@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@I see the problem. The top of your engine is gone, specifically, the cylinder head.@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Hm. Okay. That word sounds cool... but what does it mean?@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@Let me explain. The cylinder head is the top to the cylinder block. Think of the cylinder head as an airtight lid to your engine that regulates air, fuel, and exhaust.@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Okay. Cool. Informative. What is he pointing at?@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@Now this lid is important because it works to get fuel into your engine. You see, your engine has cylinders, and these cylinders are pistons. When the piston in the cylinder moves down, it creates a vacuum, pulling in fuel from the intake.@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@You mean an air-fuel mixture?@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@That's right, BMO. Have a gold star, dear.@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@Yay! BMO is so pretty and smart!@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@Then the piston returns to the top, compressing the air-fuel mixture. Then a spark plug fires off, creating an explosion, driving the piston back down, powering the engine.@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Sweet. So where's the cylinder head, then?@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@Hmm. Well, sometimes people store parts they're working on in the car. Ah! Bingo! Found it.@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Yeah! Drive time!@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@Well... n-not quite. We don't know why they took the cylinder head off. Uh, it could be cracked, the gasket head could be warped, the rod bearings could have damage from water—you see, that's the cool thing about cars. One tiny little thing messes everything else up so nothing works! So it's up to us to figure it out!@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Cool.@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@Yeah, alright.@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@Whoo. I'm bushed. You guys wanna pick this up again in the mornin'?@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Sure.@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@Sounds good!@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@Not BMO. This grease monkey's torqued up on automotive styles. Yeah, boyee!@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Okay, BMO. Good night, Banana Man.@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@Have a good evening, gents.@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@Time for the night shift.@We Fixed a Truck
Starchie (on radio)@It's ten past the hour, and this is Graveyard Shift, hosted by me, Starchie the Gravedigger, your weekly five-hour dose of all the strange haints, phantasmagoria, and phenomena I see working in the Candy Kingdom Graveyard. Hello, caller. You're on the Graveyard Shift.@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Guard (on radio)@What? Am I—oh, hi! Um, longtime listener, first-time caller. So, uh, I think Princess Bubblegum has been replaced by, like, a lizard person.@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@A lizard?@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Guard@Yeah, a lizard. I love your show.@We Fixed a Truck
Starchie@Oh, Starchie is very interested in this topic. What led you to this discovery, caller?@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@They are wrong! You look more like a hippo than a lizard.@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Guard@Well, um, my friend is a very highly-placed official in the Candy Kingdom, and I've noticed—@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@Hi, BMO.@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@Stay back, lizard!@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@Sorry, BMO. I-I didn't mean to startle you. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the truck... and biodiesel! Oh, and I figured out what's wrong with the engine block. So what are you working on?@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@Aerodynamics.@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@Swe-e-e-et! You know, it's been really nice hanging with you fellas and working on the car. It gets a little lonely at my space-age banana dome.@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@You don't have a girlfriend?@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@No. I-I don't want to be alone, but... I've gotten pretty good at it. I putter around the house, keeping busy with my little projects. But it would be nice to find someone.@We Fixed a Truck
Starchie@Hold up. Princess? Is that you? Ah, spooky.@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Yo, BMO. Coffee.@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@Thank you. @We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Car looks nice, BMO.@We Fixed a Truck

Banana Man@Uh! Ah! I fixed it! Are we best friends yet?! Oh. Oh, hey. I-I fixed it.@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@N-i-i-i-i-i-ice.@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@I discovered the cylinder head was warped so I went to the junkyard and got a new one. Bingo.@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Whoo.@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@Biodiesel.@We Fixed a Truck
Finn, Jake, BMO, and Banana Man@Yeah!@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Awesome!@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@Yow-ee-wow. She's beautiful.@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@Well, then go over and talk to her.@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@Yeah, come on, Banana Man! You're lonely!@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@Oh, no, that's okay. Having someone to love takes up time I could use to work on stuff.@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Pardon me, miss. My friend here is super smart, and he rebuilt this truck.@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@He's very smart and very single!@We Fixed a Truck
Female Banana Guard@Okay...@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@Anyway, his name is Banana Man. If you like what you see, give him a call.@We Fixed a Truck
Princess Bubblegum@He-e-e-elp m-e-e-e-e-e-e!@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@We gotta save Bubblegum!@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@No, Finn! She's a lizard!@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@You gotta stop listening to all those conspiracy shows. They twist up your noodle so you can't tell what's real.@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Look, there she is!@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@You want some tea?@We Fixed a Truck
Princess Bubblegum@Sure!@We Fixed a Truck
Princess Bubblegum@Thanks, Jake.@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@So, what's up with the angry mob, PB?@We Fixed a Truck
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, they think I've been replaced with an evil lizard replicant. It's sheer nonsense.@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@Eat this bug!@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Punch it, 'Nana Man!@We Fixed a Truck
Princess Bubblegum@What the fridge?@We Fixed a Truck
Princess Bubblegum@Finn, Jake! Reptilian synthoid replicants are trying to take over the kingdom!@We Fixed a Truck
Finn@Yeah. We know.@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@Kill it!@We Fixed a Truck
Princess Bubblegum@No, no! I'm the real one!@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@Hmm...@We Fixed a Truck
Female Banana Guard@Hey, speedy. You're comin' with me.@We Fixed a Truck
Banana Man@What? Really?@We Fixed a Truck
Female Banana Guard@Mm-hmm... 'cause you ain't got enough peel on that 'nanner! You're under arrest for public indecency!@We Fixed a Truck
Jake@Bye, Banana Man!@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@It's not fair!@We Fixed a Truck
Princess Bubblegum@It's okay, BMO. It's a very mild offense.@We Fixed a Truck
BMO@It's not like that! Hot Daniel is dead!@We Fixed a Truck

Ice King@Don't forget the bread! Haha!@Play Date (Adventure Time)
Finn@Look, I hear you. But we can't kick him out because I still feel guilty about junking up his crib. Hey, what if we check him into a hotel room?@Play Date (Adventure Time)
Jake@Hmmm?@Play Date (Adventure Time)
Finn@What's that?@Play Date (Adventure Time)
Jake@Checking him to a hotel room.@Play Date (Adventure Time)

Finn@We'll even put you up for few weeks until your place is ready.@Play Date (Adventure Time)
Ice King@Ahh, but that sounds lonely. I just like to stay here with you guys! Having roommates is nice! It keeps me out of my head. Gunther says only "Wenk!" What's up with that?@Play Date (Adventure Time)

Lady@더이상 제이크가 이상한 짓 하는 거 없을 거야. 진짜야! 그래도 내가 이 테잎 본 지 하도 오래 돼서 장담은 못 하겠네. 미안해. (I don't think there's any more weird Jake stuff. Really! But I can't promise anything, as I haven't seen this tape for years! Sorry for that.)@The Pit
Finn@Okay, high-five! Play it, BMO!@The Pit
Jake@Hmm, guess what, Lady? This dirt dog needs a bath!@The Pit
Jake@Wawoo!@The Pit

Kee-Oth@Come on, Joshua! Back in the old days, you would have been up here trying to take me apart!@The Pit
Jake@Uh, what? That's my dad, Joshua, back in the old days.@The Pit
Jake@I'm his son, dude.@The Pit
Kee-Oth@Shoot.@The Pit
Kee-Oth@Where is he?@The Pit
Jake@He's dead, dude. Don't make me get emotional about it.@The Pit
Kee-Oth@Then why you being such a wimp then? Come on up here and beat on me like your dad would.@The Pit
Jake@Okay, that's weird.@The Pit
Kee-Oth@What's weird?@The Pit
Jake@You want to get beat up? That's weird. I'm not doin' your weird biz.@The Pit
Kee-Oth@You won't fight?!@The Pit
Jake@Nope.@The Pit
Jake@What the—!@The Pit
Samantha@Hi. I'm Samantha.@The Pit
Jake@I'm Jay T.—the Dog. I'm Jake.@The Pit

Samantha@But I haven't seen a man-dog in years! And now the universe has dropped one into my arms!@The Pit
Jake@Whoa, lady, no way. This boy's got.@The Pit
Samantha@But fate has brought us together! The stars have paired you with a goddess.@The Pit
Jake@I like the way you talk, but you are crazy.@The Pit
Kee-Oth@Kill or be killed, you two!@The Pit
Samantha@Yes, if I'm so crazy, then let's fight!@The Pit
Jake@No, girl, we can bounce outta here. My friend Finn will save us any second now.@The Pit
Samantha@I don't wait for rescue. I conquer till I am conquered. By love... or by the hand of an adversary.@The Pit
Jake@Well, I guess we're gonna have to fight then.@The Pit
Kee-Oth@Okay, take your time. I gotta do my daily sun salutation.@The Pit
Kee-Oth@Release me, Joshua! I'll show you!@The Pit
Kee-Oth@Dude, your blood is harsh!@The Pit
Joshua@That's because I've been drinking so much holy water. It's in my blood, sucka! And naturally, I gotta go to the bathroom like crazy. Be right back!@The Pit
Kee-Oth@If I can't suck you, I'll suck myself's blood.@The Pit
Kee-Oth@Hehehe...Taste it, scrub! AUGH!@The Pit
Joshua@Man, I can't believe it...I gotta wee-wee again!@The Pit
Beemo@Would you like to rate this video?@The Pit
Finn@No time, Beemo. Let's go find the cave from the video. Maybe we'll find more clues there.@The Pit
Lady@잠깐! 내가 네 주위에 보호막 쳐야 돼! (Wait! I must cast a protective shield around you!)@The Pit
Lady@됐다. 이제 가도 돼. (Done, now you're good to go.)@The Pit
Finn@Kee Oth Zaple Myrups Rama Mancakes?@The Pit
Finn@Whoa.@The Pit
Finn@Jake? Yeesh.@The Pit
Kee-Oth@Eh?@The Pit
Finn@Jake?@The Pit
Jake@Finn, yes! Help me!@The Pit
Lady@Jake! 왜 저 못생긴 지지배가 널 껴안고 있는거야! (Jake! Why is that ugly chick hugging you!)@The Pit
Jake@This isn't hugging—it's fighting! Fighting!@The Pit
Finn@Jake, what do I do? Should I kill him?@The Pit
Kee-Oth@With what?@The Pit
Finn@With this!@The Pit
Kee-Oth@Demon blood...@The Pit
Finn@That's right! Demon blood beats demon!@The Pit
Jake@No, that is not correct!@The Pit
Kee-Oth@Hahahaha! Oh yeah! Gimme that blood, stupid!@The Pit
Finn@Lady! Don't break the circle of protection!@The Pit
Lady@당연하지! (Of course I won't!)@The Pit
Finn@Aw geez, he's sucking my sword off its hilt!@The Pit
Kee-Oth@Yeah, hahaha! Your circle can't stop my sucking! Now I have your demon blood as well!@The Pit
Finn@Except it's not demon blood! It's a frozen grape juice that was blessed by the priest.@The Pit
Finn@Bless this sword, fodder.@The Pit
Shelby@Mmm, check please!@The Pit
Finn@Mmm, grape-y!@The Pit
Kee-Oth@Wait... Aaaaaah!@The Pit
Jake@My blood! Woo!@The Pit
Samantha@Coward!@The Pit
Jake@Woop! Hey, hey! Lady!@The Pit
Finn@Let's go, bros!@The Pit
Jake@Samantha, you can come too, I guess.@The Pit
Samantha@Very well.@The Pit
Samantha@You've returned me to my world, so I recant my oath to destroy you.@The Pit
Jake@You made an oath. Okay.@The Pit
Samantha@Let's fight again some time.@The Pit
Jake@Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree.@The Pit
Samantha@Hmm. Took you long enough to stretch outta that pit.@The Pit
Lady@뭐, 뭐가 어떻게 된 거야? 너 저 여자한테 반한 거야 뭐야! (What is happening? Did you fall in love with that lady or what!)@The Pit
Jake@Pshh, please! Not even.@The Pit
Lady@그럼 그 함정에서 왜 그렇게 오래 버티고 있었어? (Then why did you spend that long time in the pit?)@The Pit
Jake@Uh, because... Kee-Oth was right there! An-and there were traps! I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it.@The Pit
Lady, Finn@Jake!@The Pit
Jake@Woo...Sorry, I got a little light-headed.@The Pit
Lady@아, 이 말썽꾸러기. 사랑해 자기야. (Ah, you little troublemaker, I love you, honey.)@The Pit
Jake@I love you too, Lady.@The Pit
Finn@Yo, guys, I still love Flame Princess.@The Pit
Jake@Okay, big hug!@The Pit
Finn, Jake and Lady@Hug!@The Pit
Finn@Jake...? Jake? Hey, man.@James
Jake@Hey, dude.@James
Finn@You still thinking about...@James
Jake@Yeah.@James
Finn@Yeah? Me, too. Princess Bubblegum's ready for us, so we should go.@James
Jake@Okay. Just give me a few more months in here and I'll be ready.@James
Finn@It's okay, man. Just—just play it off. Just make a—a normal face. See? Normal face.@James
Princess Bubblegum@Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming. We may begin the ceremony!@James
Finn@Thanks for bringing us along on the trip, Preebs.@James
Jake@Yeah. It's unfortunate we can't enjoy some of these cool things we're passing by, but I guess we could do that the next time we're in the Desert of Wonders, whenever that is!@James
Princess Bubblegum@We're on a mission to collect samples only. I want to start colonizing this area by the end of the year.@James
Jake@You are killing me, PB!@James
Princess Bubblegum@James, give a readout on fuel.@James
James@Right away, Princess. Boop! Boop! Boop! Boop! Beet! We have a surplus of fuel, so after we collect samples, we may explore.@James
Finn & Jake@Yeah!@James
Jake@I'm glad James is on this trip. Hey, James, thumbs up, buddy!@James
Finn@Heh. Dude, James is kind of, uh, goofy.@James
Jake@I wasn't gonna say anything, but yeah. Maybe when we get to know him better, it'll be charming.@James
Princess Bubblegum@James, slow down. We're here.@James
James@I'm registering mondo mega rads down there. I'll ready the radiation suits upon landing.@James
Princess Bubblegum@Excellent. Take us down.@James
James@Hold on to your sack lunch!@James
James@Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt!@James
Princess Bubblegum@Okay. You guys collect as many surface samples as you can—rocks, plants, dirt, anything.@James
Jake@Mostly looks like it's just dirt here.@James
James@This'll be fun. Jake, open up the basket. I'm gonna make a shot!@James
Jake@Do it!@James
James@Chk-chk! Whoop!@James
Jake@Ha ha!@James
James@Wah-wah!@James
Princess Bubblegum@Hmm.@James
Princess Bubblegum@Aah! Ach! Brownstadt!@James
Princess Bubblegum@Guys, run!@James
Princess Bubblegum@James, speed up that sack lunch!@James
James@Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt!@James
Princess Bubblegum@Ugh!@James
Finn@Ugh! Everyone okay?@James
Finn@Huh? Oh, my garf! What are they?!@James
Princess Bubblegum@Uh, they're toxic creatures from another time. Okay, let's see—suspension's all donked, navigation's lost, and the ship's legs are kaput. We're dead in the water.@James
James@Chk! Ah-oogah!@James
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, yuck! Come on! Manners! Gotta brain out the situation.@James
Princess Bubblegum@Those goo monsters will barf their way through the hull in mere minutes. Finn, what should we do?@James
Finn@Uh... let's radio for help.@James
Princess Bubblegum@Good idea, but looks like the radio's kerplowed.@James
James@I can fix that radio. Mrow-row-row! Pling! With this! It's a lucky coin! Bam! When I bust out my coin, great stuff happens, like when I was chosen to go on this mission with you guys!@James
Jake@Mnh. Mnh. James, that's not helping!@James
Finn@Don't panic, baby.@James
Princess Bubblegum@Yes. James is very resourceful. He'll work it out.@James
James@Vrrt! Veet! Vrrt! Vreet! Vrrt! Gzzzh! Jzzt! Bwr! Look, Princess! I invented a coin-operated coin screwdrive-e-er!@James
Princess Bubblegum@See what I mean? Good job, James. Come on, guys. Let's take inventory of the emergency gear.@James
James@Lucky coin strikes again!@James
Finn@Hey, Preebos, I know things seem bad, but I'll figure out a plan.@James
Princess Bubblegum@I know, Finn.@James
Jake@Dude, I found us some flares! I saved us!@James
Princess Bubblegum@Right on!@James
James@Hey, dudes, the radio is fixed!@James
Jake@Good Grod! I love you, James!@James
Princess Bubblegum@I knew you could do it, James!@James
Jake@You know, James, I wasn't sure about you at first, but you're okay.@James
James@Thanks, Jake. I wasn't sure about you either.@James
Princess Bubblegum@James, the radio's still not working! I'm not getting any signal.@James
Finn@What the skunk?!@James
Finn@James, it's all sanched up!@James
James@James is like, "Wha?!" It was working just a second ago, I swears! I went, like, "Choo-choo-choo!" and the radio was like, "Pch-choo-whichoo-whichoo-whichoo-whichoo," and then I was like...@James
Jake@I take it back. This guy's totally cuckoo! This is my cuckoo face.@James
Princess Bubblegum@He did his best, you guys.@James
Finn@Right, right. Okay, time for plan B. James, pass me them flares.@James
James@Chk-oo! Boop! A flare for m'liege.@James
Finn@James, where are the flares?!@James
James@What?! May—maybe they're, uh, invisible flares.@James
Jake@Finn, PB, can I speak to you in the other room, please?!@James
Finn@You want to do this trust-huddle style, buddy?@James
Jake@Hm.@James
Princess Bubblegum@So what's all the hubbub?@James
Jake@What's up with that James dude?@James
Finn@Yeah. Do you think James could be breaking things on purpose?@James
Princess Bubblegum@No. James wouldn't do that.@James
Jake@Wake up. Dude's a saboteur.@James
Princess Bubblegum@It's not James.@James
James@What's not James? I got lonely up front. I wanted to see what y'all are up to.@James
Finn@Hey, that gives me an idea.@James
James@Me, too! Vrrt! Just kidding! I don't have any ideas.@James
James@Diversion. D-d-d-d-d-d-diversion! Time to set up a diversion.@James
Jake@You see anything, brudda?@James
Finn@Ah, I got bunkus. Wait. If we jam up to that cliff face, I think we can climb—whoop. More goo bros.@James
Finn@What the—?!@James
Princess Bubblegum@That won't hold them for long.@James
Jake@It can't end like this. I got a lady and five kids! I thought I'd outlive at least one of them!@James
James@Here, man. Take this.@James
Jake@Your lucky coin?@James
James@Yeah, man. It always keeps me calm.@James
Finn@Who shot that flare, James?@James
Princess Bubblegum@We don't have time to point fingers.@James
Finn@You're right. There's only one way out of this jam. One of us has to eat the big one so the others can survive.@James
Finn@And I'm gonna be that one. I'll run up there and get the creatures to chase me, and while they're busy noshing on my teen-boy body, you three can climb to safety. Don't try to talk me out of it. I got crystal certainty. This is what it means to be a he—@James
Jake@Wha—?@James
Princess Bubblegum@James. We need to talk.@James
Princess Bubblegum@So, what do you say?@James
James@Sure thing, Princess! Byong!@James
Finn@Ugh! Huh? Why did—Jake?@James
Finn@Wh—where's James?@James
Finn@James!@James
Finn@Aah! James, look out! Ohh. PB! What's going on?@James
Princess Bubblegum@Finn, I need to explain something really heavy. I was the one who sabotaged all your escape plans. I calculated the chance of success for every possible escape plan, and none of them were going to work. You said it yourself there was only one way out. Someone was going to have to eat the big one to save the others. James did something really noble to save us.@James
Finn@But I wanted to do it. Why didn't you let me?@James
Princess Bubblegum@There's a reason. With this sample of James, I can clone a new one. He's candy, but you're not. I can't clone another you.@James
Finn@Whoa.@James
Princess Bubblegum@I made the best choice available.@James
Princess Bubblegum@James served the Candy Kingdom on a dangerous mission, and even though he is gone and it's super sad, I would like to honor James... with this new James I whipped up in the lab!@James
James' Clone@Jeet!@James
Princess Bubblegum@Here you go, James— an award for bravery. Let's hear it for James!@James
Finn@Is this right or wrong? I can't tell.@James
James' Clone@Hey, cool. Did I do something cool? Do I do something cool?@James
Jake@I don't know, man. Here's your coin, James.@James
James' Clone@Wow! This day keeps getting better and better!@James
Jake@Ehh.@James
Finn@Tickle, tickle, tickle.@Root Beer Guy
Jake@Wakey, wakey, wake.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Wow, that was really something.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Really something.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Sure, I'll hold. Hello? I'd like to take a few minutes of your time to tell you about an amazing vitamin supplement. But first, just let me ask you do you ever feel that no matter what you eat, you're still tired and sluggish and... filled with nagging anxiety and doubt... and...?@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy's boss@Root Beer guy, get your head back in the game!@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Hello, ma'am, I'd like to take a few minutes of your time... hello?@Root Beer Guy
Chocolate Bar@What we need is to cut out the middle man.@Root Beer Guy
Gumdrop Guy@Hey, Root Beer Guy@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Hey.@Root Beer Guy
Gumdrop Guy@Dude, we should start our own place.@Root Beer Guy
Princess Bubblegum@Next stop, Lollipop Park Estates.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@This is good. What is this?@Root Beer Guy
Cherry Cream Soda@Candy...@Root Beer Guy
Cherry Cream Soda@I've got a closing argument tomorrow, Root Beer Guy.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@I knew there was trouble. I could smell it on the hot evening breeze. Fortunately for me, trouble is my favorite thing because I'm Joe Milkshake. I kicked down the door with one swift, decisive motion... No... With one swift and decisive motion, I kicked down the door... No... The door was kicked down by me swiftly with not many motions, but a whole lot of decisiveness was used by me that was apparent to everybody... oh.@Root Beer Guy
Princess Bubblegum@What are you doing? Let me go! No!@Root Beer Guy
Finn & Jake@Yeah.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Hey, hey, are you awake?@Root Beer Guy
Cherry Cream Soda@Not really.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Well, this is going to sound crazy, but I think I saw Princess Bubblegum get kidnapped and the perpetrators were that Finn and Jake!@Root Beer Guy
Cherry Cream Soda@Okay, sweetie, that sounds like an interesting dream.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@But it did happen.@Root Beer Guy
Cherry Cream Soda@You need to eat something before you go to work. And you can't keep falling asleep at your typewriter; it's bad for your back. Besides, I miss you at night.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@I'm sorry, sweetie. I couldn't stop thinking about that weird stuff I saw last night when I was peeking through the bushes.@Root Beer Guy
Cherry Cream Soda@Peeking through the bushes?! You've been warping your mind with all this mystery stuff. I swear, sometimes I think you love that novel of yours more than you love me. You've been working on it every night for ten years and for WHAT? Look at me, Root Beer Guy. I'm a Cherry Cream Soda and I have the same needs as any other Cherry Cream Soda! Or even diet cream soda.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@I didn't know what to say, but Joe Milkshake never was a talky guy. On my way to work that morning, I decided to take a second look at the crime scene.@Root Beer Guy
Boss@Root Beer Guy. Root Beer Guy. Root Beer Guy, how many bottles of products you've sold this month?@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Zero?@Root Beer Guy
Boss@Great, you can count to zero.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@You know, maybe if you give me the new lead...@Root Beer Guy
Boss@Hmph, you haven't earned the new leads.@Root Beer Guy
Chocolate Bar@It's easier to do it when you have all the leads.@Root Beer Guy
Gumdrop Guy@Exactly.@Root Beer Guy
Chocolate Bar@Hey, Root Beer Guy.@Root Beer Guy
Gumdrop Guy@It's all about the leads.@Root Beer Guy
Finn@See? I told you, it's candy stucco. Stucco feels great.@Root Beer Guy
Jake@Mmm, when you're right you're right.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Alright, you two, what were you doing last night with Princess Bubblegum?@Root Beer Guy
Jake@Um, we were at home last night.@Root Beer Guy
Finn@Yeah, we were doing that... thing.@Root Beer Guy
Jake@That was a great thing we were doing at home with no other witnesses.@Root Beer Guy
Finn@But we're each other's witnesses.@Root Beer Guy
Finn & Jake@Yeah!@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@But I saw you.@Root Beer Guy
Finn@Look, man, you didn't see nothing.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Mr. Banana Guard, you gotta arrest those guys. Come on!@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@These are the guys, they're kidnappers. You have to arrest them and find out how they're hiding Princess Bubblegum.@Root Beer Guy
Jake@Princess Bubblegum? She's right around the corner. Oh princess Bubblegum! Yes? I think some banana guards want to speak with you.@Root Beer Guy
"Princess Bubblegum"@Where are those Banana Guards?@Root Beer Guy
Banana Guards@Your highness. Greetings, your majesty.@Root Beer Guy
Banana Guard@Your skin is looking lovely today. Princess Bubblegum really orange!@Root Beer Guy
"Princess Bubblegum"@I'm using this marmalade spray-on tan...@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Bingo bango. This was my lucky break.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@With one decisive motion, I kicked down the door.@Root Beer Guy
"Princess Bubblegum"@So... being tan is my thing now...@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Quickly, I scanned the room for the... oh man. Caramel Court, Cotton Candy Prison, Lollipop Park Estates! Bingo ban...@Root Beer Guy
Banana Guard@Aha! Huh?@Root Beer Guy
Banana Guard@Umph.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Bingo bango.@Root Beer Guy
Cherry Cream Soda@Bonsoir, monsieur (Good evening, sir). Would you like me to turn down ze bed?@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Um, look what I got! This security tape will show that Finn and Jake kidnapped Princess Bubblegum.@Root Beer Guy
Cherry Cream Soda@Finn and Jake would never do that!@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Oh, yeah? Prepare to have your mind blown! After I put this tape in the VCR just to make sure I got the right one. I'm pretty sure I did!@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Hey, yes, this is it! Bingo bango! I've gotta get to the... Are you in the tub, sweetie? I'm going out! I've gotta get this tape to the Banana Guards or the newspaper or maybe the DA or something!@Root Beer Guy
Jake@Hey, Root Beer Guy.@Root Beer Guy
Jake@You were not supposed to view this tape.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@But... but... how did you guys know?@Root Beer Guy
Cherry Cream Soda@I told them. That's right, I did it for us. Oh, this thing is eating you alive, Root Beer Guy!@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@But it's all I've got!@Root Beer Guy
Jake@Hey, this looks kinda personal.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Mr. Pudding.@Root Beer Guy
Buck Pudding@Oh, you can just call me Buck.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Oh, Buck, those.@Root Beer Guy
Buck Pudding@No need to be formal here, son.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@T-those guys were just in here, can you tell me what they bought?@Root Beer Guy
Buck Pudding@Well, let's see. A shovel, a saw, some plastic bags, some duct tape, a bludgeon, a mop, rubber glove.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Say, Mister Buck, do you know anything about this Lake Butterscotch?@Root Beer Guy
Buck Pudding@A right nice spot, Lake Butterscotch. Miles from where anyone can hear a person scream... if a person was screaming for some reason. Creepy now that I think about it. Nothing up there these days but some abandoned caverns. Nice place to hide a body if you're into that sort of thing.@Root Beer Guy
Buck Pudding@Son, now what are you doin' in my pickup truck?@Root Beer Guy
Banana Guard@Yeah?@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Don't hang up! Uh, I'm Root Beer Guy. I'm the guy who kidnapped Princess Bubblegum! Yeah, yeah, wrapped her in a carpet, yeah, and I'm gonna dump her in Lake Butterscotch! I'm completely insane, ahahahaha, but you still have time to stop me. Get up to Lake Butterscotch right now, Banana Guard...@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Uh... and I took a boat out after 8 o' clock.@Root Beer Guy
Banana Guard@Emergency! Quickly, Lake Butterscotch!@Root Beer Guy
Banana Guard@Use the licorice lace lasso!@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Oh, my word. Get those guys. They're my accomplices.@Root Beer Guy
Banana Guard@Oh, okay.@Root Beer Guy
Another Banana Guard@I got it!@Root Beer Guy
Banana Guard@Busted, you boat crimer.@Root Beer Guy
Banana Guard@Finn and Jake?@Root Beer Guy
Finn@Well, guys. It looks like you caught us.@Root Beer Guy
Finn@Okay, Princess, you can come out now.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@Princess!@Root Beer Guy
Banana Guard@Uh, yeah, it is the princess!@Root Beer Guy
Princess Bubblegum@Congratulations. Whee! Whee! You were so good at solving the case.@Root Beer Guy
Banana Guard@Um... what case?@Root Beer Guy
Princess Bubblegum@The fake kidnapping! To test the Candy Kingdom security system.@Root Beer Guy
Banana Guard@We didn't solve that case.@Root Beer Guy
Princess Bubblegum@But if you weren't following the clues I left, who was?@Root Beer Guy
Banana Guard@Um, Root Beer Guy!@Root Beer Guy
Princess Bubblegum@Then why the jumping jay is he in handcuffs?!@Root Beer Guy
Cherry Cream Soda@That was a great night , baby.@Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy@We haven't danced like that in years!@Root Beer Guy
Cherry Cream Soda@I'm so proud of you, Mr. Captain of the Banana Guards.@Root Beer Guy
Princess Bubblegum@Cinnamon Bun, what the heck are you doing out in the woods?! I asked you twenty minutes ago to take these drinks around for us.@Apple Wedding
Cinnamon Bun@Oh, oh, "around for us". I thought you said "walk to the zoo and back"!@Apple Wedding
Princess Bubblegum@Gob.@Apple Wedding
Princess Bubblegum@Finn, Cinnamon Bun's gonna attend your juice bar now. I have a special job for you.@Apple Wedding
Princess Bubblegum@As Ooo's greatest champion, I'm relying on you to keep Lumpy Space Princess from crashing this wedding. I went ahead and deputized you. So, you know, no holds barred, got it?@Apple Wedding
Finn@Yeah. Oh, what about Jake?@Apple Wedding
Princess Bubblegum@Well, honestly I haven't seen Jake this happy in a while.@Apple Wedding
Princess Bubblegum@I kinda don't want squash his groove.@Apple Wedding
Princess Bubblegum@Knock, knock. Hey, Tree Trunks.@Apple Wedding
Tree Trunks@Oh, hey, Princess. Wow, you look prettier than a sippy cup in a snowbank.@Apple Wedding
Princess Bubblegum@Thanks, Tree Trunks. Now listen, I don't want you to worry about a thing. I've got Finn on LSP Deputy, and we're keeping your ex-husbands, Randy, Danny and Wyatt, a hundred feet apart at all times - at least until it's time for me to perform the ceremony.@Apple Wedding
Tree Trunks@Oh, well, uh, Princess, I appreciate your generosity going to all this trouble to hijack my wedding and all, but you can't perform the ceremony.@Apple Wedding
Princess Bubblegum@What?! Why not?@Apple Wedding
Tree Trunks@Uh, well, I'm sorry, but I just don't recognize your quote unquote "authority" on such matters. I can only be married by His Holiness, the One True King of Ooo.@Apple Wedding
Princess Bubblegum@WHAT? That fraud?!@Apple Wedding
Tree Trunks@Now I know...@Apple Wedding
Princess Bubblegum@That fraud is here?!@Apple Wedding
Tree Trunks@Why, yes, but...@Apple Wedding
Tree Trunks@Oh, dear. Mama, I'm afraid I've offended the Princess.@Apple Wedding
Tree Trunks' mother@Oh, nonsense, baby. She's probably jealous 'cause you're about to marry a handsome, fine, saucy man. Oh, but he is a saucy, fine bologna factory. Mmmhmm, tell you what I'd like to open up that hood, see how the bologna gets made!@Apple Wedding
Tree Trunks@Mama, please! Please don't call him a saucy fine bologna factory!@Apple Wedding
Tree Trunks' mother@Bologna factory, bologna factory, bologna factory!@Apple Wedding
Tree Trunks@Oh, my perfect day. What else could go wrong?@Apple Wedding
King of Ooo@Please, go on. Describe the next thought form.@Apple Wedding
Mr. Pig's relative@Um... I see, like, reddish-green blotches.@Apple Wedding
King of Ooo@Ah... Ahaha! One year good luck.@Apple Wedding
Princess Bubblegum@I've waited a long time for this King of Ooo, and now I'm gonna expose you in front of everyone for what you really are!@Apple Wedding
BMO@Yay!@Apple Wedding
Wyatt@Hey, uh, barkeep, can I have another one of these ciders?@Apple Wedding
Cinnamon Bun@Sure!@Apple Wedding
Wyatt@Hey, little robot. How ya doing?@Apple Wedding
BMO@I am the best! I love weddings, I love flowers! I love LOVE!@Apple Wedding
Wyatt@Hey, did you know I used to be married to Tree Trunks?@Apple Wedding
BMO@No!@Apple Wedding
Wyatt@Heh, yeah... it's just me and TT. We had some wild times back in the day. Did you know I once taught her to play tennis?@Apple Wedding
BMO@No...@Apple Wedding
Wyatt@Yep, tennis! I took her to one of those... uh... paddles... or whatever, you know!@Apple Wedding
BMO@No.@Apple Wedding
Wyatt@Yeah, she left me. She said I was stifling her spirit... I mean hehe... You know, what? Not enough tennis for ya?@Apple Wedding
BMO@No.@Apple Wedding
Mr. Pig's relative@It's starting! The ceremony is starting!@Apple Wedding
BMO@Oh no! I'm missing the love!@Apple Wedding
Wyatt@No! Uh, please stay here! This is cathartic. You're a good listener.@Apple Wedding
BMO@Oh, okay...@Apple Wedding
Mr Pig@Psst, Sweetie, you look so nice.@Apple Wedding
Tree Trunks@Shh...@Apple Wedding
Finn@Sounds really sweet.@Apple Wedding
Finn@Lumpy Space Princess? Is that you?@Apple Wedding
Lumpy Space Princess@Let me go to this party...@Apple Wedding
Finn@It's not your party, LSP.@Apple Wedding
Lumpy Space Princess@Poor Finn. Don't you know? Every party is my party.@Apple Wedding
Princess Bubblegum@I'm just gonna look in this guy's blimp. Make sure everything's in accordance... with the laws.@Apple Wedding
Mr. Pig@Psst... sweetie, what are ya doing?@Apple Wedding
Lumpy Space Princess@Get out of my way, Finn. Oh my glob, you're touching my woman body!@Apple Wedding
King of Ooo@Okay, dear, now up you come.@Apple Wedding

Tree Trunks@Hey yeah! King of Ooo, will you do the honors?@Apple Wedding

Finn@Don't come around every day, uh? I love it.@Blade of Grass
Jake@Well, that was easy.@Blade of Grass
Man@Remember, no take backs.@Blade of Grass
Jake@Hey, the pillow vendor!@Blade of Grass

Jake@Pie!@Blade of Grass
Finn@Hyut! Hyut!@Blade of Grass
Finn@Hyaaaah!♪@Blade of Grass
Tree Trunks@Howdy, boys! Nice pillow and nice sword. My hands are full, Finn. Uh, you mind slicin' an apple for me?@Blade of Grass
Finn@Hyut!@Blade of Grass
Tree Trunks@Something is terribly wrong with that awful sword.@Blade of Grass
Jake@He's gettin' really good. He saved me from pizza.@Blade of Grass
Tree Trunks@That apple slicing is too perfect... demonically perfect. That sword is cursed!@Blade of Grass
Jake@I like it when Tree Trunks gets all serious.@Blade of Grass
Jake@Uh, how's that curse doin'? Makin' you want to moidle me?@Blade of Grass

Jake@Don't worry. I'll handle this. There.@Blade of Grass
Finn@Let's go return that junk.@Blade of Grass
Jake@Huh. Hey, he's not here.@Blade of Grass
Finn@Hmm. Maybe someone around here knows where he is.@Blade of Grass
Finn@Somebody in trouble!@Blade of Grass
Suzy & Sue@Help! They're taking our candles!@Blade of Grass
Jake@It's the Hooligans Who Love Candles!@Blade of Grass
Finn@Let's get 'em! Hey!@Blade of Grass
Hooligans carrying candle@Huh?@Blade of Grass

Choose Goose@Hmm.@Blade of Grass
Finn@I made a mistake, CG. This merch is totally defective. Please.@Blade of Grass
Choose Goose@Okay-dokay... I know that quack with the grassy shack. He's a wizard from the grassy plain. He lives atop the grassy moun... tayn.@Blade of Grass
Jake@Awesome. Wizard of Grassy Moun-tayn... Mountain. Yeah, thanks, Choogs.@Blade of Grass
Finn@Yeah, thanks!@Blade of Grass
Choose Goose@He's the only one who can lift the curse, but beware...@Blade of Grass
Choose Goose@He's a huge ding-wad—just the worst.@Blade of Grass
Finn@Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop!@Blade of Grass
Finn@Hmm. For a cursed dingus, you cut so good.@Blade of Grass
Finn@Come forth, wizard, and uncurse my mitt! Grassy Mountain Wizard!@Blade of Grass
Grassy Wizard@Comin' up here tryin' to enter my house! Are you for real?! Mow 'em down, my cursed grassy objects!@Blade of Grass

Grassy Wizard@Uh... go forth! Go... uh, forth. That was all my grassy objects.@Blade of Grass
Finn@Lift the curse.@Blade of Grass
Grassy Wizard@Never! You have no power over me, young fool! The grass sword will be part of you for all eternity!@Blade of Grass
Finn@Hmm. You know what? I think I'm cool with that.@Blade of Grass
Grassy Wizard@What?@Blade of Grass
Finn@Whoa.@Blade of Grass
Jake@Now that you've accepted it, you can control it!@Blade of Grass
Finn@Yeah. This is really cool! I just had to get used to it.@Blade of Grass
Grassy Wizard@That's not how people are supposed to react to an eternal curse!@Blade of Grass
Finn & Jake@Whatevs.@Blade of Grass
Jake@Do it again!@Blade of Grass
Finn@Good morning, Princess!@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@Finn! You scared me!@Rattleballs
Finn@I am sorry, Princess!@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@What are you doing here, Finn?@Rattleballs
Finn@Since I got out of my last relationship, I've been slackin' on the job. So I'm rededicating my life to protecting, serving, and meeting your every need. Jake said I was acting bananas about the whole thing and wanted no part of this.@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@It's 530 in the morning.@Rattleballs
Finn@That's right, Princess. I'm gettin' back on the job hardcore, giving 100% of my being all for you.@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@Thank you, that's very nice.@Rattleballs
Finn@No need to thank me, PB. It's my job.@Rattleballs
Finn@Heh.@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@Thank you.@Rattleballs
Finn@How am I doin' my job, Princess? Am I crushin' it?@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@Yes, but can you move just a bit...@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@No, no, like, out of the way.@Rattleballs
Finn@Oh!@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@Okay, what else do I need? Aw, dangit, I forgot we're out of milk. Now I have to go get it from—@Rattleballs
Finn@Buh-buh-buh! I got it! Hyah!@Rattleballs
Finn@Milk... You wanted milk...@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@Finn, I thought you went home.@Rattleballs
Finn@Yes, I do regret the slow return, but I assure you, this is the highest quality milk available. It's mink's milk. I milked a mink. 100% dedication, no limits for what I do for you. I'd throw Peppermint Butler off this balcony if you ask. Sorry, Peppermint Butler, just joking, but kinda sorta not.@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@You're really going over the top here. Take it easy. Princess's orders.@Rattleballs
Finn@Okay, I'll just rest here.@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@No, no, resting on the job is not resting. Go somewhere where you can relax!@Rattleballs
Finn@Yes, Princess.@Rattleballs
Finn@Princess, I give my life to you girl, you are the best dang princess in the whole wide world. Wow, PB, sure is a nice day to be outside! Hey, watch what you say about PB, bro. Talk garbage about PB one more time, bro. See what happens! Hold on one sec, PB. I gotta deal with a real tough guy over here. You got one last chance to apologize before I dishonor you like you did my lady! Alright, bro, have it your way! Yah! Where's your pants bro? Where's your honor now? Everyone's laughing at your undies! It's real uncomfortable! Wants some! Wowzers! No! Did you drop this car on my lady, bro?!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@Leave this dump now!@Rattleballs
Finn@You dropped a car on my lady, bro. Now I gotta restore her honor. I hope you're wearing underwear. Whoa, dude's got awesome powers. Hey, dude, you got awesome powers! You gonna kill me, bro?@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@No. Instead, I will pluck out your eyes with the point of my sword, and whenever you try to see stuff, you will think only of me, Rattleballs!@Rattleballs
Finn@Do it! I ain't a baby! Do it, bro!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@You have a warrior's spirit! Something I haven't seen in a long time. But your swordsmanship is . You should learn to master your weapon before you draw it.@Rattleballs
Finn@What?! You're just gonna tell me I'm terrible and walk away? Teach me sword stuff, man!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@I know you're back there.@Rattleballs
Finn@I brought you a muffin.@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@I don't eat muffins; I'm a robot.@Rattleballs
Finn@Look, I know you don't know me and we got off on the wrong foot, but please, dude, teach me how to use the sword. Please! You okay?@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@No. When I was a young robot, I went horseback riding. No one taught me how to post. The horse took a crazy jump, and I came down on the saddle hard. One of my gumballs bounced up inside me. It's been lodged in a weird spot for years.@Rattleballs
Finn@Oh, here.@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@More to the left! Getting closer. Closer! You got it! Thank you!@Rattleballs
Finn@Yeah, perhaps you feel a sense of indebted obligation to me?@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@Yes! I will teach you the sword stuff.@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@Lesson one block my eggs!@Rattleballs
Finn@Yut! Ha, got one!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@Hahahahaha! Egg-celent!@Rattleballs
Finn@Yeah! That's right! I can take it!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@You have done well today! You have felt the sting of the yolk, endured the sizzle of the mini-BBQ. Perhaps you are ready to learn my secret technique.@Rattleballs
Finn@Secret technique!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@Watch!@Rattleballs
Finn@What the—?!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@The shadowless thrust. Your blade must be swift enough to slice the air between you and the target, removing all wind resistance. Now you try. Again.@Rattleballs
Finn@So, am I a master swordsman now?@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@You will be if you train this hard every day... for ten years... and get a robot body.@Rattleballs
Finn@Oh. So, uh, why you livin' in this dump? You should be out in the world, saving fancy ladies and junk.@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@That, my friend, is a long tale... which I will tell you now. It was a much wilder time in the Candy Kingdom. I was a member of an elite robot police force created by Princess Bubblegum. Her previous attempts at law enforcement had been a bunch of goofs.@Rattleballs
Shop Owner@Stop Him!@Rattleballs
Banana Guards@Go! Go! Go! Go!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@Our righteous swords cut a swath through the chaos, but we were too successful. Unfortunately, we were still programmed for violence.@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two. Okay, robots, all the number ones, go stand on that platform over there. And all the number twos, just turn around and face the wall. And no peeking!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@We were programmed to follow her commands 100%, but through sheer force of will, I was able to overcome it. We had been judged too dangerous to stay operational and sentenced to death!@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@Number twos! Chop, chop!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@I alone escaped, while my compatriots became minimalist furniture.@Rattleballs
Finn@Oh, sorry!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@I've lived as a fugitive in this junkyard ever since. That is why you must never tell Princess Bubblegum about me. If she ever found out, she would have me destroyed.@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@Rattleballs is still what?!@Rattleballs
Finn@He asked me not to tell you, but I cannot break my oath to serve you, my lady, 100%.@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@Captain Root Beer Guy, assemble my guard!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@Hello, Princess.@Rattleballs
Finn@Sorry Ree-B-Z. My oath to the princess comes first, but once you two talk it out, I know she'll see you mean no harm.@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@Banana Guards, destroy!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@So be it!@Rattleballs
Finn@Wait!@Rattleballs
Banana Guards@CHARGE! WEEWOOWEEWOO! CHARGE!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@Rattleballs!@Rattleballs
Finn@RB, don't!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@You think I'm dangerous, Princess?@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@Dang right I do! You killed all my banana guards!@Rattleballs
Finn@No, Princess, look! They're only bruised!@Rattleballs
Banana Guards@Hey, you hit me!@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@I no longer crave mindless violence. I have found peace in meditation, gardening, egg throwing. I also hope time has made you less bloodthirsty, princess, but do with me as you will. In my heart I still serve you, 100%.@Rattleballs
TV@Bigger pimples mean bigger dimples, so mash-@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@Ahem! Okay, everyone, I took care of Rattleballs.@Rattleballs
Banana Guard@Oh! Wow! Cool! Show's back on!@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@Everything's settled. I don't have to go back on my order, and you can protect the kingdom from the shadows.@Rattleballs
Rattleballs@Thank you, Princess. That's marginally better than hiding in a dump.@Rattleballs
Princess Bubblegum@Wait! I dub thee Sir Rattleballs!@Rattleballs
Flame Messenger@Whoo-hoo!@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Next.@The Red Throne
Flame Person@Oh, Your Highness, can you help my poor child? His hair is starting to go, and we can't afford flame care and...@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Take this fortifier. It should last you through the cold season.@The Red Throne
Flame Person@Oh, Glob bless thy soul!@The Red Throne
Ursula@More tea, Your Highness?@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Thank you.@The Red Throne
Ursula@Mm-hmm.@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Who's next?@The Red Throne
Flame Person@Hi, um, my microwave seems to be broken, and— aah!@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@Flame Princess!@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Don John—the Flame Lord!@The Red Throne
Don John@I fear you're not evil enough to rule the kingdom.@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Excuse me? How dare you! What?@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@You've been poisoning me. How could you, Ursula? Guards!@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Huh?@The Red Throne
Flame King@Oh, here he comes!@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@No!@The Red Throne
Flame King@Yes! Playtime's over, honey. Time to give Daddy his throne back. I've secretly arranged to make Don John my vizier and give him my daughter's hand in marriage.@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@Uh, yeah, I know.@The Red Throne
Flame King@Ha-ha!@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@Hwah!@The Red Throne
Flame King@Man, you're looking shredded.@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@My gym is dark magic, and my protein shake is rage.@The Red Throne
Flame King@Okay, okay.@The Red Throne
Flame King@Splendid work, Don John.@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@No big D, bro.@The Red Throne
Flame King@Heavens to Betsy!@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Cinnamon Bun!@The Red Throne
Flame King@Don't let them escape!@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@Come here, girl. We're getting hitched!@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@No! Go away!@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@I can't leave. I have to fight for my kingdom!@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@No. Fight later. Now we get help.@The Red Throne
Flame King@Huh? Aah!@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@Hwah!@The Red Throne
Flame King@Why did I jump?@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Thanks, CB.@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@You're welcome. How are you feeling?@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@A little better, I think.@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Who should we go to for help? Princess Bubblegum?@The Red Throne
Both@Nah.@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@I don't trust her.@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Yeah, she's devious.@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Well, I've seen Finn battle huge monsters and even armies, and we need somebody who can fight... CB, take me to Finn.@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Mmm, okay.@The Red Throne
Finn@Waah!@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Finn!@The Red Throne
Finn@Um... hey. Uh, Jake isn't here. He's sleeping over at Lady Rainicorn's maybe.@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Finn, I've been slowly poisoned by my treacherous handmaiden. Now my powers are weakened, and—and the Flame Lord has freed my father and threatened to marry me. But I escaped with CB.@The Red Throne
Finn@Oh, what?! I'll help you. I'll do anything for you.@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Listen, Finn, this doesn't mean we're getting back together. We're all business.@The Red Throne
Finn@Mm-hmm. Of course.@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Yeah, business.@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@I'm feeling exhausted. Where can I freshen up?@The Red Throne
Finn@Girls' bathroom is over there. Also, it's the boys' bathroom.@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Oh, thanks.@The Red Throne
Finn@So, what do you think, CB? You think I still have a shot with her, right?@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@No.@The Red Throne
Finn@Does she ever talk about me? Is she seeing anybody?@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@No and no.@The Red Throne
Finn@"No and no," she does talk about me, or "no and no," she isn't seeing anybody?@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Alright, guys, let's wolf.@The Red Throne
Finn@So... your Fire Wolf can fly.@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Yep. I taught him.@The Red Throne
Finn@Hmm. Whoa! You've cooled down a lot.@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@No funny stuff.@The Red Throne
Finn@Things have been going great for me lately. Been hanging out with my boys. I got a cursed sword arm now, so that's new. Yeah, I've been exercising a lot and taking some piano lessons—trying to improve myself. Not dating anybody or anything, just getting a little me time, being the best Finn I can be.@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Hyup!@The Red Throne
Finn@Oh, no!@The Red Throne
Finn@I hid my flameproof suit behind these rocks... just in case, whatever, you know?@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@So, the guards are posted here and here, so we should probably sneak in here.@The Red Throne
Finn@Suited!@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Uh...@The Red Throne
Finn@Remember my fire suit? Hey, CB, you did a great job getting us here and everything, but I got this, all right?@The Red Throne
Finn@I got a sword arm, so—@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Yeah, you said that.@The Red Throne
Finn@Watch this. Hey, guards! Come at me at the same time!@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@What are you doing?!@The Red Throne
Finn@Let's go, Princess!@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@But that wasn't the plan! No!@The Red Throne
Finn@Ha-ha!@The Red Throne
Flame Guard@It's the princess.@The Red Throne
Flame Guards@Capture them!@The Red Throne
Finn@Ahhhhhh—@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@No, Finn, don't hurt them! They're entranced!@The Red Throne
Finn@Oh, right. Oh, no.@The Red Throne
Flame Guards@Captured.@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Hyah! Um...@The Red Throne
Finn@There's CB!@The Red Throne
Flame Guard@Get that bun!@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Could you move, please?@The Red Throne
Flame Guard@Whoo, get him, boys! We're taking these two away.@The Red Throne
Finn@Don't worry, FP, your boy Finn won't fail you.@The Red Throne
Flame Guard@Put up your dukes. You have permission to leave when you out-duke us.@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Okay.@The Red Throne
Flame Guards@Duke! Duke! Duke!@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Duke! Uh, duke! These two are out-duked! Now I'm making my escape.@The Red Throne
Finn@Trust me. It'll be fine.@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@For soon you shall be mine. If you've forgotten, I'm reminding you now.@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Never!@The Red Throne
Finn@Yeah! It's because you secretly still have feelings for me.@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@No!@The Red Throne
Finn@Hmm.@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@I can never marry you, because I don't even know you, much less like you, and forcing me to marry you is gross.@The Red Throne
Flame King@Whoo! Whoo! Man, I love staring out over things. Whoo! It's so good to be king.@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@You said she'd do whatever you told her.@The Red Throne
Flame King@Umm, okay...@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@But she refuses to marry me. She's her own woman, you liar!@The Red Throne
Flame King@Liar? You want to fight me?@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@Aye—fistfight.@The Red Throne
Flame King@Yes... I'll fistfight you. Come on!@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@You hit me? Felt good!@The Red Throne
Flame King@Oof! I love fistfighting. You dirty bread breaker.@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@Aah!@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@Put them down. Put your dukes down.@The Red Throne
Flame King@No!@The Red Throne
Finn & Flame Princess@Whaa?@The Red Throne
Finn & Flame Princess@We're saved!@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Hi. Got a key.@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@Fight!@The Red Throne
Flame King@Fight!@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@They're distracted. Let's go!@The Red Throne
Flame King@Leg press!@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@Stamina... failing.@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@Cheater!@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Onward, Jake 2!@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Aah!@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@CB, are you okay?@The Red Throne
Female Flame Person@Huh? What happened?@The Red Throne
Male Flame Person@Should—should we keep attacking?@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Stop! You were all brainwashed... by him!@The Red Throne
Flame King@Uh-oh.@The Red Throne
Female Flame Person@Hey, I don't like that guy!@The Red Throne
Male Flame Person@Yeah, let's get him!@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@Capture him!@The Red Throne
Flame King@It wasn't me. It was Don John! Aah!@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@Huh? Oh...@The Red Throne
Flame Lord@Aah!@The Red Throne
Flame King@Have you all gone dumb from Don John's magic? I mean, how do you expect this softy to rule you? She's even weaker than before from being poisoned. Look!@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Oh, come on.@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@You're wrong. Flame Princess may not be the most ruthless of all despots, but she is strong where it really counts—in her heart. And that is good.@The Red Throne
Cinnamon Bun@I have learned so much watching this beautiful woman work, and with her example, I have become a better man. I will be by her side as her champion and knight every step of the way because... I love her.@The Red Throne
Flame Princess@Thank you.@The Red Throne
Flame Person@Aw, how sweet!@The Red Throne
Finn@Jeez. Did I just get shown up by Cinnamon Bun?@The Red Throne
Bella Noche@Have you obtained the staff of Stranson Doughblow?@Betty
Forest Wizard@Yes, Bella Noche. We procured the staff using the full extent of our wizardy ways.@Betty
Bella Noche@Then the time has come to reveal my true form, and when I materialize on this...@Betty
Ice King@Oh, this striz is going down, man.@Betty
Bella Noche@...you will receive your end of the deal.@Betty
Laser Wizard@The lost system of Antediluvian magick—the tightest of all wiz biz.@Betty
Forest Wizard@So right and tight, I get restless leg syndrome about it. Look.@Betty
Bella Noche@And now, it will be yours.@Betty
Ice King@And mine!@Betty
Forest Wizard@What the blood?! Ice King!@Betty
Ice King@Listen, dudes, all I want is to be in the club and plus up my magic. What's the problem?@Betty
Laser Wizard@Your life is my problem.@Betty
Bella Noche@Too late, fools! Bella Noche emerges!@Betty
Forest Wizard@Whoa! What the—?@Betty
Grand Master Wizard@Stop that now, trash cones! Bella Noche must not cross into our world!@Betty
Ice King@Eh, why not, again?@Betty
Grand Master Wizard@Duck!@Betty
Grand Master Wizard@Aw, cram! Here we go!@Betty
Forest Wizard@Uhhhh... hey. Hey, I—I can't feel my magic!@Betty
Laser Wizard@Me neither. What gives?@Betty
Grand Master Wizard@Bella Noche is a being of pure anti-magic! Y'alls got played!@Betty
Simon@Uh, hello?@Betty
Forest Wizard@Oh, what a fool am I! Aaaaaaaaaaah!@Betty
Grand Master Wizard@Go! Destroy! Throw your boots at it, or—I don't know!@Betty
Simon@Huh?@Betty
Grand Master Wizard@Dang. Sorry, Ice King.@Betty
Simon@This must be it, man. I've crossed into some super-insane zone where I feel like I'm just normal again. Or maybe I'm just normal again.@Betty
Ash@Hey, stop looking at yourself. You're ugly, bro. Get lost. This is my busking spot.@Betty
Simon@Sorry, man. No time! Go, carpet! Whoa! It's got to be here. Even in my prolonged state of insanity, my immutable essence must have known to—oh, yes. Hello. Ah, my research. My jackie—jacket! Mutation, mutation, mind expa—aha! "Mystic Rituals And Their Space Time Applications" by Simon Petrikov and Betty Grof. Betty. Whoops. Marceline?@Betty
Marceline@A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four.@Betty
Finn@Wait!@Betty
Marceline@What?@Betty
Finn@Why are you holding your bass up high like that?@Betty
Marceline@Mm-mm-mmm. (I don't know.) I get better finger action this way.@Betty
Finn@But you look like a nerd. Move it back down. It's better.@Betty
Jake@Move the bass down.@Betty
Finn@A-move the bass a-down.@Betty
Jake@Be reasonable.@Betty
Marceline@Yes?@Betty
Simon@Marcy, it's me, Simon. I'm back, but my body might donk out soon, so get to the Ice Kingdom fast and help me with this time portal so I can find Betty and say I'm sorry before I croakboat! I know that's a lot to process, but hurry, and bring Hambo. Hambo is the key.@Betty
Simon (over telephone)@Okay, Marcy? You got that? Marcy?@Betty
Marceline@A long, long time ago, Simon was my only friend. He was there when I needed help.@Betty
Marceline@All he ever wanted was to find Betty, and now I can help him.@Betty
Marceline@Simon?@Betty
Gunter@Wenk! Wenk!@Betty
Marceline@Simon!@Betty
Simon@Marceline!@Betty
Marceline@I thought I'd never see you again.@Betty
Simon@I can hardly believe it myself. You're all grown up.@Betty
Jake@Believe! She's like a million years old!@Betty
Simon@One million years? How could it be?!@Betty
Marceline@He's just kidding. I'm only a thousand.@Betty
Jake@And still looking good!@Betty
Finn@Do you remember anything from when you were the Ice King?@Betty
Simon@Nothing specific—just dreamlike impressions.@Betty
Finn@Do you still have impressions from all the times we flipped your bricks?@Betty
Simon@I have... bruises. Excuse me. I—@Betty
Marceline@Man, Simon.@Betty
Simon@I'm fine.@Betty
Marceline@You're dying!@Betty
Simon@Well, yes, but only in increments. I've still got work to do. Finn and Jake, will you run my generator?@Betty
Finn@Yeah, man.@Betty
Jake@Cool.@Betty
Simon@That's great! Keep pedaling! All we need now is the catalyst—an object from the past that has been lovingly tended to through the ages.@Betty
Marceline@Goodbye, Hambo.@Betty
Simon@Because of you, I can say goodbye to Betty and tell her I'm sorry for driving her away. Thank you, Marceline.@Betty
Ice King@Where's my Betty? Where's my princess?! Princess! Princess!!@Betty
Betty@Simon, don't leave me like this.@Betty
Simon@Betty? Betty. Betty!@Betty
Betty@Simon? What is going on?@Betty
Simon@I'm a thousand years in the future, love. I opened this portal so we could say goodbye.@Betty
Betty@You're dumping me?@Betty
Simon@No! It's just that everything changed after I put on that crown. I—I went crazy. You ran away. I—I never saw you again.@Betty
Betty@But where would I go without you?@Betty
Simon@I'll never know.@Betty
Betty@I don't understand. You don't seem crazy now. I mean, in the future.@Betty
Simon@The portal is closing. There's no time to explain. Just know that I love you, and I forgive you for leaving me.@Betty
Betty@Simon, I know who I'm leaving you for!@Betty
Simon@Who?@Betty
Betty@You, dum-dum!@Betty
Betty@Simon? What's wrong? Are you sick?@Betty
Simon@No, I'm old. The crown was keeping me alive, but its magic was negated by the creature Bella Noche.@Betty
Betty@Don't die, Simon. I just got here.@Betty
Simon@Oh, I'm sorry, Betty.@Betty
Betty@I know! I'll fix the crown, and then I'll figure out how to fix you!@Betty
Simon@What? No. Guys, stop her.@Betty
Jake@Uh...@Betty
Marceline@Hmm...@Betty
Finn@Yeah, but...@Betty
Jake@It kind of sounds like a good idea.@Betty
Betty@Right, whoever you are. I'm sorry. It's the only way.@Betty
Simon@No!@Betty
Betty@Okay, rug, take me to Bella Noche.@Betty
Betty@Get on, Simon!@Betty
Simon@I am getting on... the death bus.@Betty
Death@I've got you in my sights, Simon.@Betty
Simon@It's my time, Betty! I don't want to be the Ice King again. It's like living with eternal diaper butt. I can't do it!@Betty
Betty@Not forever. Destroying Bella Noche and getting your power back will buy me time to find a loophole that'll undo your curse and your death. I can do it! You got to believe me, Simon.@Betty
Simon@I...@Betty
Death@Get real, man. You're gonna be the Ice King till the sun blows up. This is your one chance. I made a mix tape for the ride "Summer Jams 3"!@Betty
Simon@If I don't let her try, then what am I? What am us?@Betty
Betty@What?@Betty
Death@Eh, fair enough. See you in a few.@Betty
Grand Master Wizard@This brioche won't stop growing. Ron James, what took... you?@Betty
Ron James@Yo, my lab got creamed! I had to dummy-rig an alchemical filter out of a dirty bidet and a vaporizer!@Betty
Grand Master Wizard@But will the double-negative magic work?@Betty
Ron James@Heck yeah! Ron James always delivers! Check it out, brotha! Yaah! In your face!@Betty
Grand Master Wizard & Ron James@Yeah!@Betty
Grand Master Wizard@What the stink is that?!@Betty
Ron James@My lab conditions were not ideal.@Betty
Grand Master Wizard@But you did not deliver!@Betty
Ron James@Peace, man! Aaah!@Betty
Betty@We're here to help!@Betty
Grand Master Wizard@Help how?@Betty
Grand Master Wizard@We're toast, bro.@Betty
Betty@Simon!@Betty
Betty@Hey, don't scare me like that.@Betty
Simon@Just hold my hand to your face. This will be my... last sensation.@Betty
Betty@Don't be a wimp, Simon! Just give me a second!@Betty
Death@You got about 15 seconds.@Betty
Bella Noche@How the—? Wait.@Betty
Betty@Surprise! Tranch.@Betty
Death@You lose, Simon. Sorry, man.@Betty
Ice King@Uh, huh?@Betty
Ice King@This a party? Huh?@Betty
Grand Master Wizard@Wizard City is saved!@Betty
Ice King@Whoa! Heh. Okay. Whoopee!@Betty
Ice King@So then, Ron James told me this girl I was with flew into Bella Noche and mysteriously defeated it for me! Wow!@Betty
Ice King@Just my luck, right? Black out for a day and meet the woman of your dreams.@Betty
Muscle Princess@I will get you!@Betty
Ice King@Hey, don't be jealous, Muscle Princess. She's gone—kablooey. Let's be realistic, right? We both know you're not my top pick.@Betty
Ice King@Oh, Grod!@Betty
Ice King@No!@Betty
Ice King@Aaah! Go home! You can go! Aah!@Betty
Princess Bubblegum@Ladies and gentlemen, I have invented time travel. This phasical sphere is flooded with info waves that scan every second, logging every molecule that passes through its volume. I made special gloves for it.@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@Now check it out! It's logging time.@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@I'll set the clock back now.@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@Now I'll push the time travel button.@Bad Timing
Jake@Eh... It's not really time travel, though. You just, you know, moved their stuff around. You didn't really manipulate time. Ice King's done it better before... with magic.@Bad Timing
Mudscamp@Well, I enjoyed your presentation very much, Princess. Thank you for inviting me.@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@No!@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@For all intents and purposes, they traveled back to an earlier point in their time.@Bad Timing
Jake@Eh, I guess, but not really.@Bad Timing
Jake@I mean, Ice King did it for real. Guy pulled his fiancée out of time from a thousand years ago using magic.@Bad Timing
Mudscamp@Hey, time, where's my fiancée? Am I right?@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@Jake, don't deny my science. This is a time travel machine.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Take me back to when my ex-boyfriend Brad still loved me!@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@LSP...@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Wha?@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@LSP, that's not how it works. It can only rearrange your molecules into a previously logged formation, and you need these gloves.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Give them to me.@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@No.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@You witch! Give them to me now!@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@No, I'm sorry, but you need to pull yourself to—@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@You skunk! You skunk! You skunk! You pretty skunk! You don't know heartache with the whole Candy Kingdom in love with your pretty bubblegum buns!@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Glob!@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@Hear me, Lumpy Space Princess, I will avoid declaring war on the entirety of Lumpy Space, ruled by your parents, if you apologize to me immediately.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@I'm sorry-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y... I'm sorry you're so stupid.@Bad Timing
Jake & Punch Bowl@Whoa!@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@Sheesh!@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Everyone in here is a loser. Nobody's as good as Brad. Oh, Brad! Why can't I get over you?@Bad Timing
Bartender@Have you tried burning an effigy? That's what they do in movies.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@This isn't a movie, Charlie, it's real life!@Bad Timing
Bartender@Another cucumber water, Your Majesty?@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@What?@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Person@Oh, I—I'm sorry for staring, but, uh, I—I know you. We used to—@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Everyone knows me. I'm Lumpy Space Princess.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Person@No, uh, from high school. W-we were lab partners. I'm Johnnie.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Ugly Johnnie?@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Y-yeah, uh, you used to call me that quite a bit.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Yeah, but I can't call you that anymore! Come on, sit up straight. Lemme see them eyes.@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Mm.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Do it.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Nope. Can't call you that anymore. So, what brings you to the Candy Kingdom, Johnnie?@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Business, uh, actually. I own my own company, bottling and distributing Lumpy gas.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Mm-hmm.@Bad Timing
Johnnie@And I'm up for a big contract, uh, here in the kingdom, which could really help my business "take off," so to speak.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@That's so cool. You're like your own boss or whatever.@Bad Timing
Johnnie@To be honest, I'm a little nervous about this meeting tomorrow.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Why, Johnnie?@Bad Timing
Johnnie@I'm bad at talking to people.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@That's because you have poor posture.@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Really?@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@You gotta stop slouching!@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Now look me in the eye!@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Yeah, stay like that.@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Boy, LSP, heh, you sure are making me feel good about myself.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@You feeling good makes me feel good, Johnnie. So... where are you staying while you're in town?@Bad Timing
Johnnie@I'm sub-letting a friend's apartment.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Talk is cheap, Johnnie. You should take me there.@Bad Timing
Johnnie@That chair—oh, it used to be over there, but I moved it.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Johnnie, it's so nice. You've really made it your own.@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Thanks.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Ooh, records! Okay, wanna see something funny?@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Yeah.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Okay. Okay. Sit down!@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Okay, are you ready?@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Heh-heh, yeah!@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Okay!@Bad Timing
Johnnie@It's his face, but on your body!@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@I know! That's the joke. My friend Melissa and I came up with that. You're smart that you get it.@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Boy, when this evening started, I was feeling so dump trucks, but now it's like a hundred forklifts!@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@I feel the same way, Johnnie.@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Do you feel this couch?@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@What?@Bad Timing
Johnnie@'Cause it's where you're gonna sleep!@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Seriously. It's getting late, and I don't want you walking home. So I insist. I'll be in the other room, sleeping peacefully... and dreaming about you.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Johnnie...@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Thank you... for everything.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Johnnie... go to bed already. You have a big day tomorrow.@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Good night!@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Rise and shine! I hope you like pancakes 'cause I got— oh. I guess she'll be the one who got away.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Looking for someone?@Bad Timing
Johnnie@You're still here!@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@'Course I am! Now make me some breakfast!@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Okay, Johnnie, good luck at your meeting. And remember, I'll be right over there, sending you good vibes while you're wowing Princess Bubblegum.@Bad Timing
Banana Guard@Yo, why are you so confident, man? Aren't you nervous to meet the princess?@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Nope! My GF is back at my place sending me good vibes.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Johnnie's friend has so many movie channels.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Ha-ha, that movie was so dumb. Oh, poop! Johnnie's meeting! I wonder how it went.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Johnnie! Oh, Johnnie, you're home! How'd it go? Oh, don't keep me in suspense, Johnnie!@Bad Timing
Johnnie@I did it, babe! I landed the sale!@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Johnnie, that's wonderful!@Bad Timing
Johnnie@And I couldn't have done it without you.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@I know!@Bad Timing
Johnnie@And here's the best part! She wants me back at the castle tonight to go over the contracts during a royal dinner.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, my Glob! It's gonna be so nice to have dinner inside the castle. It's been a while.@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Oh. No. It's a business meeting, not social. Just me and the princess, I'm afraid.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@What?!@Bad Timing
Johnnie@LSP?@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@So... Bubblegum thinks she can horn in on my territory? Sip from my soup after I cut all the onions? Yo, think again, tranch.@Bad Timing
Mudscamp@Who—who are you talking to?@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@So how are you enjoying your time in the Candy Kingdom?@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Oh, it's just great. I met this amazing purple girl at the Candy Tavern.@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@That's wonderful, Johnnie. Now tell me more about gas...@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, Johnnie... Ugly Johnnie, through my tender love you have metamorphed into Beautiful Johnnie Butterfly. Every relationship, I gamble with my heart. I go all in because the payoff is true love. I see you when I close my eyes, and thinking of you makes my mind feel light. All my problems fade away, and I can't help smiling. Heh. To let someone you love go into the arms of another takes a big person. I don't know... if I can be that big. Rah! Eh, ehh.@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@We're under attack!@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Can I help?@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@No. Hide yourself beneath the tablecloth. There's cyanide-laced gum under the table. Chew it if you hear raiders break down the door.@Bad Timing
Johnnie@Okay.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Hi, Johnnie.@Bad Timing
Johnnie@What are you doing here?@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@I'm going to time-travel you back to when we first met at the tavern—back to when you loved me—so we can have a second chance.@Bad Timing
Johnnie@What?@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Uh!@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@Manfried, where are the Banana Guards?@Bad Timing
Manfried@Take a chill pill, Princess. I handled it.@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@What did you handle?@Bad Timing
Manfried@You know. Someone drove their car in the door, but no one was driving, and it exploded, so I handled it.@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@Mmm. Don't chew it! Don't chew it! Don't chew it!@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Johnnie? C'mon. Sit up straight. Let me see them eyes. Ha-ha. Uh.@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@He's not here.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@What? But I sent him back.@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@The sphere would have had to log his molecules before you engaged the time travel function.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Well, then where is he?@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@I don't know.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Then if he's gone, can you send me back...?@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@To before I met him so I won't have to remember this heartache?!@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@If that's what you want.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Do it. Do it!@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@You witch! Give them to—huh, wha? What? Where are we?@Bad Timing
Princess Bubblegum@You asked me to use this.@Bad Timing
Lumpy Space Princess@Don't touch me! You pretty skunk! You don't know heartache with the whole Candy Kingdom in love with your bubblegum buns...!@Bad Timing
Earl of Lemongrab@Hello! And keep away from Castle Lemongrab!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab@How are you today? Mm, I see. Yes. I'm inside my fortified totalitarian city-state. Hello, I'm Lemongrab.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab 2@Me too!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab 2@Ow!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab@Mm. Unacceptable.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab@Things have never been better here at Castle Lemongrab.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab@I have never been fatter.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab@And since the expulsion of Lemonhope...@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab@We have reached peak societal obediency.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab@Law, order...@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab@Harp-smashing.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab@We've have it all!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab@Mm, the pleasure. Smash another! Ooh, who is this?@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab@I'm one of my subjects! I'm being punished for helping Lemonhope. But that's okay!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab@Yes, morale has never been higher since we got rid of hope. In conclusion, no one needs to come here ever, especially Lemonhope, and I ate my brother. Goodbye!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab 2@Save us, Lemonhope! You're our only lemon-ho—!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Princess Bubblegum@Lights on. Oh, Lemonhope, were you even paying attention?@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemonhope@Mmmmmm, yes.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Princess Bubblegum@I know this is a lot to take in, but one day, saving those lemons is going to be your responsibility. They're in trouble, and you need to work harder at this.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemonhope@Eh... I don't know. I'm not too worried about other people, I guess. Like, I got me, and they got them. Mm.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Princess Bubblegum@O-kay... Let's try something else. These are cupcakes.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Finn@Cup-cups!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Princess Bubblegum@Lemonhope, you have two cupcakes. Finn has no cupcakes. Lemonhope, will you give Finn one of your cupcakes?@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemonhope@Um...@Lemonhope: Part 1
Finn@Yes.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemonhope@Oh... but I don't want to! I want both cupcakes. Finn can get his own cupcakes!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Princess Bubblegum@Maybe we need something more hands-on. Hey, Finn, listen, that's it for class today.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Finn@Whoop! Whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop...@Lemonhope: Part 1
Princess Bubblegum@But read the next three chapters of your geometry text! Well, at least he's street-smart. Okay, dude, we're going on a field-trip.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Princess Bubblegum@This is the Lemon Earldom perimeter. Unfortunately, there are pacts and treaties preventing me from getting any closer. We should cloak. I know you don't like thinking about Castle Lemongrab, but it's where your family is. They set you free, and now they're being punished for it. It rips. Look!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemon Person@Remember, Lemonhope!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab@I'm going to eat you!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab@I did it!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Princess Bubblegum@D'ya see? They helped you. You have to help them now. It's your responsibility.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemonhope@No! I don't have to do anything that I don't want to. They set me free, and free means I decide what I do, not them and not you!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Princess Bubblegum@Dude, I'm sorry, but that attitude is unacceptable—oh! I mean... Lemonhope?@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemonhope@♪Lemonhope's got feet that take him to fun. Lemonhope's got meat that's warm in the sun. Lemonhope's got no future plans, fully undeterred. No shirts, no pants, no "won't"s, no "can't"s.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemonhope@♪My body's free like a li'l baby bird. Caw! Lemonhope's got legs that'll strut hot struts. Lemonhope's got thighs that'll pump both butts. He's... got a harp, s'got a flute, free to strum, free to toot! Free from PB-gum, I'm a lemon of freedom!♪ Oh. It's warm.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Pirate@Pick it up, you chumps! We've got to make Deaveston by brunch.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemonhope@Oh, man, that thing looks just lousy with freedom... straight-up right out the diddle-doo, comin' at ya right straight up. Ha-ha!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemonhope@Yeah, exactly. A-ha-ha-ha! Wha-a-at? Okay... It takes all kinds, I guess!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Pirate@Argh! A Greed Lard!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemonhope@Oh, my fontanelle. Hello? I—I accidentally came on to your boat, but—but I think I really need some help.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab 2@Hey. Hey, guy. Back here.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab 2@Hey, c'mon, I've fallen off back there. Guy? Hey, buddy.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Princess Bubblegum@Psst. Down here.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Princess Bubblegum@Psst. Lemonhope, it's me. You are... You are unacceptable!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemongrab 2@Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy...@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemonhope@A lot of nightmares again. I guess that's freedom for you. Oh.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemonhope@Mm. Thirsty. Nothing like juice for breakfast. Oh. I guess that's the rest of those. Well, I guess if there's no juice, I got freedom to go find water.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemonhope@Huh. Weird cloud's still there. Couldn't rain a little, could ya? Huh, cloud? Eh, what are you gonna do? Freedom not to rain, I guess.@Lemonhope: Part 1
Lemonhope@Lemonhope's got meat that's warm in the sun. My lemon of... freedom!@Lemonhope: Part 1
Phlannel Boxingday@Psst. Lemonhope.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@Hey. That's better.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@Who are you?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@My name's Phlannel Boxingday, and I've been watching you and your hard, hot life in this desert from up there in my cloud trawler. I thought you might need a hand.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@Mm-hmm.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@Kid, truth be told, you're looking a little raw. You're totally free to come hang out with me until you're feeling stronger.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@Mm...@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@It's your choice.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@Ha-ha, let's go, dude.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@So... read any good books lately?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@Oh, I can't read. They tried to teach me in school, but... mm, I just faked it.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@Ah-hah... Uh-oh. Hold that thought, buddy. Looks like a Greed Lard's picked up our scent. Dangit, he's a fast one. We can't outrun him, but maybe we can drive him off. I need you to play that flute of yours, Lemonhope. I saw how you rassled those scorpions before. Now play that flute with all your might!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@Keep it up, Lemonhope. It's working! He's turning off!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@No, wait. He—he's mad. We've enraged him. He's calling his pack. The harp, Lemonhope! Quick, quick, quick!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@We'll lure the beast into the rocks.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@No! Phlannel! Stop the ship! Stop the ship!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@What? What for?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@STOP THE SHIP!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@You see, Lemonhope? It's not peeps. It's dosh!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@Oh.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@Greed Lards eat dosh for food, and 'cause we killed it, we get to keep it all. That's my job, Lemonhope. When I'm not out being free and having adventures, I'm killing monsters that eat dosh and then keeping the dosh. And it just so happens that I'm looking for a new apprentice. What do you think about partnering up with old Phlannel Boxingday?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@Oh, my gosh, Phlannel, yes! It's a dream come true! A dream come true! A dream come true...@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@♪Poor little Lemonhope. Throw me a lemon-rope. Is there a home for me and my harp? A place where my friends... give me hu—?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Cow@Hey. Hey... What's going on back there? Somethin' don't feel right. Oh, hey! Lemonhope is here! Hey, man, how's it goin—?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Cow@Whoa, what the heck?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Cow@Run for it, Lemonhope! Run, run! C'mon! Why aren't you running?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@Morning, Lemonhope! Hey, is there any more white coal down in the hold? More black diamonds equals more love potions. The old three Rs, y'know what I'm saying? Ro-ro-romance. No, man, I can't wait for some love. It's been so lo— whoops. Oh, drats. Oh, well. Hey, don't sweat it, buddy. It wasn't your fault.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@It's not that, Phlannel. I had a bad dream.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@Again? That's the third time this week.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@I'm free now, Phlannel, to do all whatevs I ever wanted, but all I think about is my old life. What does it mean?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@Well, it's true you are free—free to help the Lemon People or leave them be—but a debt unpaid is not easily forgotten. So you are a prisoner still in deinem kopf(in your head).@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@Huh. That's what Mistress always said, and I didn't even listen.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@Ah, Lemonhope, you're a doer, not a listener. You learn with your heart and hands, not your head. So... what will you do, Lemonhope?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@I'll... I'll go back, and I'll help my people, and maybe I'll feel better.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@And how will you do it?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@Um... with my harp and... my flute! And help from my friend Phlannel!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Phlannel Boxingday@Nah, little Lemonhope. Of course, I'll take you as far as I can, but I can't interfere directly in Lemongrab politics. All those old pacts and treaties have me sklonked up tighter than a synthetic zanoit sterilizer bed compressor tube enlarger on garbage day.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@♪Lemonhope's family held in Lemongrab's lair. Saving them will save me, but... I am pretty scared.♪@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@Hmm...@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab@Looking for something?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab@Well, you found me, fat Lemongrab.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab@Oh, what's that you've got? Ah-ha, your little harp? But what's this? I've got things in my ears tonight! So now I'm invincible!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab 2@Play it, Lemonhope!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab@What? I—speak up, child!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@I didn't say anything.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab 2@The harp! Hurry! I'll take care of the rest!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab@What?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab 2@The harp, Lemonhope! Play it!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab@Oh, the harp! Didn't I just explain? I've got things in my—@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab@My—my—my things!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab@Let—Let me go! Let me go!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab 2@The harp, Lemonhope! The harp!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab@This sounds awful!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab 2@Faster, Lemonhope!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab 2@Faster, Lemonhope!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab@I can't stands no more!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab 2@Faster!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab@AAAAAAAAAAAAAH—!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@Hmm?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@Coming!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@Wait, I'm—I'm—I'm coming!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@Hello? H—Hello?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Princess Bubblegum@You know, I was thinking, Lemonhope. Maybe you'd like to stay here in Lemongrab while Lemongrab recovers. Ever kingdom needs a champion, and you're a true champion if ever I've seen one. Plus, I already set up a little room for you.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@Is he gonna stay like that?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Princess Bubblegum@Like what? Oh, heh, no, no-no-no-no. Once his brains and bodies remix, he should be back to his lonely old self, which seems to be his only stable relationship model.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemongrab 3@Me!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Princess Bubblegum@So will you stay, Lemonhope, and help your people once more?@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@Nah, that's okay.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, but I thought...@Lemonhope: Part 2
Lemonhope@I mean, you guys are cool and all, but I mostly came back here so I could stop thinking about y'all all the time. I'll be back when I'm tired of being free. See you in a thousand years, I guess. Peace!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Finn@Wow. I really thought he was gonna stay.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Princess Bubblegum@Me too. I even wrote a song about it.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Princess Bubblegum@Hey! Don't laugh.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Finn@Let me hear it!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Princess Bubblegum@No! It's terrible.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Finn@Come on!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Princess Bubblegum@No!@Lemonhope: Part 2
Finn@Come on! Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it...@Lemonhope: Part 2
Princess Bubblegum@Gah! Okay, okay.@Lemonhope: Part 2
Rap Bear@Yo! Check, check, one, two! Hey! I'm Rap Bear! I can rap... like that. Ha-ha, I'm back! It's a battle of rhymes. I'm gonna do it this time. I'm Rap Bear. My raps are mystical... quantum physics! Whoo!@Billy's Bucket List
Crowd@Whoa!@Billy's Bucket List
Rap Bear@Yeah, yeah!@Billy's Bucket List
Jake@Boo! That was pre-written. It's so obvious! Take him out, Finn!@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Off...@Billy's Bucket List
Starchie@Nope.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Off the dome, here we go. Uh! I'm-a start it now. I'm-a battle now. We gonna make a rhyme, so I can rap this time. I rap for millions... sesquipedalians.@Billy's Bucket List
Starchie@Yeah, that was tight.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Whoo! Huh? Rap Bear, what's wrong, man?@Billy's Bucket List
Rap Bear@How can I be Rap Bear if I'm not the best?@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@No way! You are the best! Going up against you was a dream come true. I look up to you, man. You're like... You're like my hero, Rap Bear.@Billy's Bucket List
Jake@Awesome.@Billy's Bucket List
Rap Bear@Thank you, Finn.@Billy's Bucket List
Party Pat@I thought Billy was your hero.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Yeah, but Billy's dead, so... Billy.@Billy's Bucket List
Billy@Ha-ha! Check out these dummies.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Ha-ha! Yeah! You're awesome Billy! Ha-ha!@Billy's Bucket List
Monster@You're gonna pay for this, Billy!@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Sick.@Billy's Bucket List
Billy@Billy!@Billy's Bucket List
Party Bear@I love rap music, but only when it's good rap.@Billy's Bucket List
Woman@Finn! Finn! Finn.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Huh? Who dat?@Billy's Bucket List
Woman@I'm Canyon, Billy's ex-girlfriend.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Say what?! That's so weird. I was just— Party Pat was just like—@Billy's Bucket List
Jake@What's going on here? Who's that?@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@This is Billy's ex-girlfriend.@Billy's Bucket List
Jake@His special Lady?@Billy's Bucket List
Canyon@No, his ex-girlfriend.@Billy's Bucket List
Jake@Oh, man, I'm sorry. Well, I hope you guys get back together. Whoo-oop!@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Jake's still in denial about Billy.@Billy's Bucket List
Canyon@Billy and I broke up four years ago, but I held on to this.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Billy's loincloth!@Billy's Bucket List
Canyon@After Billy died, I couldn't keep it in my place anymore. I heard you guys were friends, so when I saw your name on the rap battle flyer, I thought it would be cool to bring it to you.@Billy's Bucket List
Starchie@Oh, that's some smelly.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Thank you, Canyon. I guess I've been in denial, too. Have you been back to Billy's crack?@Billy's Bucket List
Canyon@No, I can't.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@It's time to go see Billy's crack.@Billy's Bucket List
Canyon@Shouldn't Jake be here?@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@He needs more time. This would mess him up too much.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Fairies! Oh, they've infested the place! Okay, you guys, out! This is Billy's crack.@Billy's Bucket List
Gnome 1@Billy got aced by the Lich.@Billy's Bucket List
Gnome 2@We have dibs on the crack, so beat it!@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@I'll dib up your brains if you don't respect the mems of Billy.@Billy's Bucket List
Jordan@Flimsy threats! Like a tiny blade of grass in a maelstrom, you are. That storm is me, Jordan, Lord of the Fairies. I ain't afraid of you or this big—@Billy's Bucket List
Jordan@You think you can chump me like that? This breeze feels great, doofus!@Billy's Bucket List
Jordan's head@All right.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Laters.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Um, so, Canyon, why did you and Billy break up?@Billy's Bucket List
Canyon@Huh? Oh. Well, I loved Billy, and I believed in him, but then Billy stopped believing, and that jammed up our whole deal—being a top-tier, red-belt power couple. After a while, all he did was watch movies and play video games. Pretty lame, right? So I bailed.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Even heroes have slumps, bro.@Billy's Bucket List
Canyon@Yeah, I know. I heard he was making a comeback, too. What a weird world.@Billy's Bucket List
Billy@Billy!@Billy's Bucket List
Canyon@What the—?@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@What is it?@Billy's Bucket List
Canyon@It looks like Billy's bucket list.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Whoa, let me see!@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Hmm. Looks like he got to most of these. He sure lived a full life. Okay, here's one. Wait. "Tell Finn that thing." What the butt is that?@Billy's Bucket List
Canyon@I don't know.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Okay, that's gonna bother me forever. Well—well, here's one more. We should do it for Billy.@Billy's Bucket List
Canyon@What's that?@Billy's Bucket List
Canyon@Are you sure you're okay?@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Holy shram! Whoo!@Billy's Bucket List
Canyon@That was awesome, Finn. You know, you remind me of Billy when he was young.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Whoa. So... can I see you sometime?@Billy's Bucket List
Canyon@I have a feeling our paths will cross again. Take care, Finn.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@"Take Canyon on one last ride." Whoops. What? Another item? You sneaky Billy. "Lie on my back in the ocean. Just float." Cool. Why the ocean, Billy?!@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Okay, Finn, don't think about your fear. Just jump in there like it's no biggie. Do it for Billy. For Billy!@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@I'm afraid. I'm afraid! Oh, dang, here he comes! Here comes the Fear Feaster!@Billy's Bucket List
Fear Feaster@Way to go, Finn the Coward. Still afraid of the ocean, eh? You should just give up! You're not a hero. You're a wimp-o! A cringing, cowardly—@Billy's Bucket List
Fear Feaster@Hey, where you going? Fool, I come with. Ha-ha! I'm gonna nosh on your insecurities. Then I'll—I'll squat on your hopes. So now what, little boy?@Billy's Bucket List
Fear Feaster@Huh? Uh, hey, man, don't do anything stupid. Hey! You're too chicken to face your fears with open eyes? This stank is cheating!@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@This stank is for Billy.@Billy's Bucket List
Fear Feaster@No!@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Huh? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@For Billy!@Billy's Bucket List
Fear Feaster@Wake up. Wake up!@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Huh? Whoa!@Billy's Bucket List
Fear Feaster@No mortal blade can harm—@Billy's Bucket List
Fear Feaster@What?!@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Was that you or me? Huh? Hey. Hey! I—I'm doing it! I'm not afraid of the ocean anymore! I'm doing it, Billy.@Billy's Bucket List
Billy@Billy!@Billy's Bucket List
Billy@You finished my list. Now I can rest like a great hero. Thank you, Finn.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@You're welcome. Canyon helped, too.@Billy's Bucket List
Billy@Tell Canyon I watch her sleep. Man, love is weird, Finn.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@I know. Is that the thing you wanted to tell me?@Billy's Bucket List
Billy@No. Goodbye.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Wait. Billy!@Billy's Bucket List
Billy@What?@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@What's the thing you wanted to tell me?@Billy's Bucket List
Billy@Oh, uh, you must go to the Citadel. That's where your father is.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@Joshua's not alive. Me and Jake buried him behind the—@Billy's Bucket List
Billy@Not Joshua! Your other dad. Dad the Human.@Billy's Bucket List
Finn@What?@Billy's Bucket List
Billy@Your father, Finn. He's alive.@Billy's Bucket List
Grob Gob Glob Grod@Denise, we have concluded you're an interesting and conventionally hot woman. My siblings and I would like to request a date with you. Are you available for a date with Glob on Saturday, Grod on Friday, Grob on Thursday or Gob on Sunday? Please select your dates now.@Wake Up
Party God@Ahhh-rooo! That's nice.@Wake Up
Cloud kid 1@Eat it, Lich!@Wake Up
Cloud Kid 2@Eat it, Lich!@Wake Up
Both@Woooh!@Wake Up
Jake@What?! No more crackers? Eeeee. Prismo! Prismo! Hey man, Hey!@Wake Up
Prismo@Heeeey.@Wake Up
Jake@Bad news, you ran out of cheese crackers.@Wake Up
Prismo@What! No.@Wake Up
Jake@Yeah, man, what are you going to do about it?@Wake Up
Prismo@Jaaake. I'm Prismo the wish master. We can have all the cheesy crackers we want.@Wake Up
Jake@Prismo, you make me happy, Prismo.@Wake Up
Prismo@Oh, stop.@Wake Up
Jake@I'm always smiling when I'm around you. I just noticed that. I always am.@Wake Up
Prismo@I'm always smiling when I'm around you, too.@Wake Up
Jake@This feels so good.@Wake Up
Both Prismo and Jake@Peppermint Butler! Death!@Wake Up
Jake@What's up.@Wake Up
Peppermint Butler@Hey umm, those guys are doing selfies on The Lich. Is that safe?@Wake Up
Grob Gob Glob Grod@Definitely going to send these to Denise.@Wake Up
Prismo@Oh yeah, it's fine, he's harmless.@Wake Up
Peppermint Butler@Yeah, but why isn't he killing everyone in the room right now? Controlling our minds, making us rip each others eyes out while we buttercup one another?@Wake Up
Prismo@Well, The Lich's primary function is to cause mass death. And since he can't do that while he is trapped in my Time Room, he's stuck in a standstill, like a machine without a purpose.@Wake Up
Peppermint Butler@I am so scared right now.@Wake Up
Death@Yikes.@Wake Up
Jake@Aw, don't worry, he ain't gonna hurt nobody.@Wake Up
Jake@Ha! You got a cup on your head. Ha-ha, you dingus! See, he's docile as a lamb.@Wake Up
Peppermint Butler@Hmm. Well, okay, then I guess I can go for a selfie, too.@Wake Up
Jake@Yeah, man, make your dreams come true.@Wake Up
Jake@Oh, what time is it? Hey, yo, Clock Face, what time is it?!@Wake Up
Clock Face@It's 1230.@Wake Up
Jake@Aw, boo to that! Yo, Prismo I gotta get back before Finn realizes I'm not home. He gets worried if I stay out too long.@Wake Up
Prismo@All right, later, dude.@Wake Up
Jake@Laters.@Wake Up
Finn@Jake, where were you?@Wake Up
Jake@I was, umm, in the, uh... All right, man, I'm gonna come clean. I've been doing a lot of partying at Prismo's lately.@Wake Up
Jake@Come on, man! I don't even take Lady up there.@Wake Up
Finn@Dude, I found out my human dad is still alive.@Wake Up
Jake@Whoa, what?@Wake Up
Finn@He's at some place called the Citadel.@Wake Up
Jake@Whoa. Are you gonna go see him?@Wake Up
Finn@I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't. Maybe there's a good reason why he didn't raise me. Like, he was probably captured by thieves and kept a slave for years.@Wake Up
Jake@Yeah, or maybe he was ambushed in the wild and hid you so you wouldn't be captured, too.@Wake Up
Finn@Yeah, maybe it's better not to rock the boat.@Wake Up
Jake@But... it might also be good to find out if you have any genetic risk factors or allergies or whatever. Plus, you get to see what you'll look as an old guy. Could be cool.@Wake Up
Finn@Heh. I guess it would be okay to meet him, just to know what I'll look like.@Wake Up
Jake@Cool. Oh! If we hurry, Prismo might be still partying.@Wake Up
Cosmic Owl@Come on, just one more game.@Wake Up
Prismo@I don't know, mang, I was just gonna clean up and crash out.@Wake Up
Cosmic Owl@Oh, yeah! More players!@Wake Up
Cosmic Owl@You guys wanna play some Card Wars?@Wake Up
Jake@No. Prismo, we need to get to the Citadel.@Wake Up
Prismo@Whoa! You guys do not wanna go there. Seriously. Check this out. The Citadel is a nasty-sized prison. Only the worst of the worst end up there. Real stink faces. These guys are the pits—the armpits.@Wake Up
Finn@Hey, my dad must be like the warden there.@Wake Up
Jake@I know you can't grant Finn and me any more wishes. So, we brought Shelby along to wish on our behalf.@Wake Up
Shelby@Hello.@Wake Up
Prismo@Oh, look at that, a little guy.@Wake Up
Shelby@So, I wish for ... a pony for my GF!@Wake Up
Prismo@Done.@Wake Up
Jake@Shelby!@Wake Up
Shelby@Sorry, dudes. My girl's been hounding me for a pony for months. I'm gonna get mad points for this. Oh, hi! So you got it? That's great! You like him? Uh huh ... you gonna name him what? Speedboat? Yeah, that's a good one.@Wake Up
Jake@Dang, Shelby.@Wake Up
Prismo@A wish wouldn't have worked anyway. You can only get to The Citadel committing a cosmic crime.@Wake Up
Jake@So, what do we gotta do? Rob a cosmic bank? Steal a space baby?@Wake Up
Cosmic Owl@Oh, uh, I just remembered I gotta go home. Gotta groom my feathers Goodbye! Goodbye!@Wake Up
Prismo@Listen, if you guys are serious about this, all you gotta do is find a certain sleeping old man and bring him here.@Wake Up
Jake@That's it?@Wake Up
Prismo@Yep. He's on one of those floating islands out there. It kind of looks like an upside-down duck.@Wake Up
Jake@That doesn't seem much of a crime.@Wake Up
Prismo@Yeah, but that's all there is to it. For now.@Wake Up
Jake@What?@Wake Up
Prismo@Check it out! I got gifts for you guys.@Wake Up
Finn@Ha, cool it's a penlight. Jake, don't look directly me in the—Aaah!@Wake Up
Jake@Oh, oh, sorry.@Wake Up
Jake@Come on, Finn let's go find this old guy.@Wake Up
Prismo@Oh! One last thing, dudes. Whatever you do, don't wake him up. Okay, you can go now.@Wake Up
Finn@Pew! Pew!@Wake Up
Finn@You ever wonder what happened to make a place all wrecked up like this?@Wake Up
Jake@Nope. Hey, upside-down duck!@Wake Up
Jake@No, wait, it's right side up.@Wake Up
Jake@Aha!@Wake Up
Jake@Hey! Get out here, old man!@Wake Up
Finn@Dude, shh. Don't wake him up.@Wake Up
Jake@Hey, get out here, old man.@Wake Up
Finn@Pizow!@Wake Up
Finn@Old man.@Wake Up
Jake@Uh oh! Finn, a little help?@Wake Up
Finn@Bizzow@Wake Up
Jake@Gizzow@Wake Up
Finn@Let's hoof it!@Wake Up
Finn@Jake, don't jostle the package.@Wake Up
Finn@Yahct! All right!@Wake Up
Finn@There's too many of them!@Wake Up
Jake@Let's see here.@Wake Up
Prismo@Oh, hey, your back.@Wake Up
Jake@Dude's got serious night terrors.@Wake Up
Finn@What now, Prismo?@Wake Up
Prismo@Okay, wake him up.@Wake Up
Both Finn and Jake@What?!@Wake Up
Prismo@Yeah, I just wanted one last look at myself.@Wake Up
Finn@Wait, this old man is you?@Wake Up
Prismo@That's right Prismo is nothing than dream of a wrinkly old man. Man, I've gotten a lot hairier, but also balder? Tell me how that makes any sense. I'm like a big ol' hairy raisin.@Wake Up
Jake@So, wait, what happens to him when we wake him up?@Wake Up
Prismo@Poof! I'm a goner. Thus ends mighty Prismo.@Wake Up
Jake@Prismo.@Wake Up
Prismo@Killing a wish master is a cosmic crime. Once I'm dead, the guardian will show up and take you to The Citadel.@Wake Up
Finn@I don't think seeing my dad is worth sacrificing your life@Wake Up
Prismo@Ah, don't worry. As soon as my corporeal body falls back asleep again, in a thousand years, I'll be back.@Wake Up
Jake@You sure about this?@Wake Up
Prismo@Hold on, let me take one last look around.@Wake Up
Prismo@Huh, thought I'd own more stuff by now. Okay, let's do it!@Wake Up
Jake@Still feels like a bad idea, man.@Wake Up
Prismo@Pssh! What could go wrong?@Wake Up
The Lich@Wake up.@Wake Up
Prismo@Wa—Wait, I've changed my mind—@Wake Up
Jake@Prismo, don't worry! I'll put the old man to sleep and get you back!@Wake Up
Finn@Dude! That means The Lich jacked our entry into The Citadel.@Wake Up
Jake@Aw, no man, how are you gonna see your dad?!@Wake Up
Old man Prismo@Hello? Who are you guys? Could any of you strangers tell me how to go home? I'm done with my nap.@Wake Up
Jake@Old man Prismo.@Wake Up
Old man Prismo@I just woke up from my nap, but I'm ready to go back to bed. I'd like to go home and take a nap.@Wake Up
Jake@No, old man Prismo, don't talk to him.@Wake Up
Old man Prismo@Are you my son?@Wake Up
Jake@Old man Prismo! No!@Wake Up
Jake@Lich! I'm gonna kill you!@Wake Up
Finn@Oh, dang! I think they're going to the Citadel! I'M COMING, DADDEEEEEEE!@Wake Up
Finn@Wait, wait, wait, wait!@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@Look, Jake. More guardians. The Citadel, I presume.@Escape from the Citadel
Jake@Likely so.@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@Hey. Do you think maybe one of them could be my dad?@Escape from the Citadel
Jake@Eh, I don't think so. We'll probably know when we see him.@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@Right, right that makes sense.@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@Hey! The Lich again! This must be where the prison cells be at. See? Good riddance to you. I hope you rot forever, you awful jerk clapper! Some people just make the world a worse place to be in just by being around, Jake. That's right. Bad apples. Lock 'em all up, I say. At the bottom of the ocean where it's too dark to see 'em.@Escape from the Citadel
Jake@Look at that weird ol' kid over there. Man, look at his clo—@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@Daddy! Aah! All locked up in there. D-Do you think maybe he's a criminal too?@Escape from the Citadel
Jake@Well, it had crossed my mind.@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@Jeez, man! Now I wish I hadn't said all that stuff before. Now my heart feels yellow and green. Maybe we shouldn't even have come here—waah!? Jake, what did you do?@Escape from the Citadel
Jake@It wasn't me! It came from up there!@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@He's melting the crystal all up! Breaking cats out left and right. Turning cats gray. Did he trick us again? I think he did.@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@Hey, kid! Hey, do me a favor. Get me out of here, huh? This fire smells crazy!@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@Thanks, kid. Now, where'd you guys park your Star Skipper? This place is coming down quick, and I mean quick, like zip zip. Like wow, like boom boom wow.@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@Oh. We... we don't have a Star Skipper.@Escape from the Citadel
Jake@Also, Finn is your son.@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@Whaaat? No Star Skipper?@Escape from the Citadel
Jake@Ahem! I said, Finn's your son. He came along way to meet you.@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@Son? Oh, hey, good for you, kid. In other news, I still gotta get out of here and the ground is melting. Huh? It's all pooling to the center.@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@Hey, um... I... I wanted to ask you something. I... well... Hey, wait up! Dad, wait! Dad, I need to ask you —- aah!@Escape from the Citadel
Starchie@Whoa!@Escape from the Citadel
Void Caster@WEE-nah-nah-gah gah-duh-gah-gah-uah.@Escape from the Citadel
Jake@Finn, I know we normally come out of these things okay, but I got a bad feeling about this. Just promise me that if both my eyes get fried off, you'll fry off your eyes too.@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@What? No. Listen, you don't gotta worry about a thing, Jake ol' pal. We just need to defeat those five space villains, hijack the shard they're hijacking and sail it home to safety. Easy peasy.@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@Yeah, Jake, smarten up. Soon as the last guardian dies, the fighting stops. See? He's biting the dust right now.@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@Aahh! Uh oh!@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@It's-- It's okay. It's okay. You just gotta fetch me a gob of that guardian blood, son. It's got that good nooch that keeps us young in the crystal.@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@Nooch?@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@Come on now, partner. No dawdling, your old man needs ya.@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@Atta boy, Flynn! Do it for your old man! Yeah, yeah, just get right in there! Don't be shy. Yeah!@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@Hey, good job, son! Rub some of that sap on my leg there. Make sure to get it into the chicken wing hole.@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@Dad...@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@Martin.@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@Okay, M-Martin. We need to talk.@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@Yeah, okay, kid, but hurry it up. I'm trying to act cool here, but this thing really stings!@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@Why'd you abandon me in the forest when I was a little baby???@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@Oh... I mean... Heh. You know me. I'm a funny guy.@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@I don't know. It was a long time ago. Who knows, maybe you left me!@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@But hey, daddy's back! You and me daddy and baby, or should I say...baby and daddy. Now slap that sap! Whoa! would you look at that! Smooth like new. Pssh, couldn't fix the boot too, huh?@Escape from the Citadel
Jake@Dude! S'mores important junk happening! Look!@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@It's time to peel bananas on this fool, as a family! How about it, Martin? Mmmm! Wha?@Escape from the Citadel
The Lich@Fall.@Escape from the Citadel
The Lich@You are alone, child. There is only darkness for you, and only death for your people. These Ancients are just the beginning.@Escape from the Citadel
The Lich@I will command a great and terrible army; and we will sail to a billion worlds. We will sail until every light has been extinguished. You are strong, child. But I am beyond strength. I am the end. And I have come for you, Finn.@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@Oh, you don't like this stuff, huh? Whoa! Right in the doorbell. Dad. Jake, finish off the Lich. I gotta go catch my dad.@Escape from the Citadel

Martin@Hey, hey, you're a void caster, right? We gotta put some gas in this buggy.@Escape from the Citadel
Jake@Finn! Let go! It's not worth it!@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@Oh, gross. Pedal to the metal!@Escape from the Citadel
Martin@Hey, what about air—?@Escape from the Citadel
Jake@It'll be okay, dude.@Escape from the Citadel
Finn@I mean, at least you finished off the Lich, right?@Escape from the Citadel
Jake@Oh, yeah, that's the good news I didn't have to! One sec. Up you go! Check this out! Brand new baby. The Lich is super cute now, and he smells real neat! That sap rebooted him or something. I like him a lot.@Escape from the Citadel
Starchie@Over here, fellas! Next stop, the Candy Kingdom. Previous stop, this weird place.@Escape from the Citadel
Tree Trunks@Mr. Pig, I think we should get a di—@Escape from the Citadel
Jake@Okay, run. Go, go, go!@Escape from the Citadel
Tree Trunks@Oh! Oh, this changes everything!@Escape from the Citadel
The Lich@Hello!@Escape from the Citadel
Finn & Jake@Willy! Willy! Oh, Willy!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@Sh! There it is. The weeping Willy. One drop of its rare sap can flavor an entire stock pot of soup.@James II
Clone James@Danger, danger! Whoop whoop! Loose gravel!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@James?@James II
Clone James@Look out princess! Poot poot poot shooh!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@Ow!@James II

Time card@3 months ago@James II
James@I'm registering mondo mega rads down there.@James II
Finn@Huh? Oh, my garf! What are they?!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@They're toxic creatures, from another time.@James II
Jake@It can't end like this.@James II
Finn@James!@James II
Finn@I wanted to do it. Why didn't you let me?@James II
Princess Bubblegum@Someone was going to have to eat the big one to save the others.@James II
Princess Bubblegum@And even though he is gone, and it's super sad, I would like to honor James… With this new James I whipped up in the lab!@James II
Clone James@Jeet!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@Here you go, James— an award for bravery. Let's hear it for James!@James II
Finn@Wow. James sacrificed his life for you again, PB.@James II
Jake@Yeah, that's like the twenty-fifth time, right?@James II
Finn@Yeah, obviously we'll have to re-clone him.@James II
Jake@Totes.@James II
Princess Bubblegum@Now hold up. This ground is perfectly solid. There's no loose gravel here.@James II
Jake@So what? Clone him up, girl.@James II
Princess Bubblegum@James is too reckless. I can't reward this kind of foolish behavior forever. It's time James takes his eternal nap.@James II
Finn@But it's James!@James II
Jake@Come P-Gum, don't be all cold-hearty!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@I'm putting my foot down. There will be no more Jameses.@James II
Finn@No...@James II
Princess Bubblegum@I'm sorry. Look, I need you guys to go to James's apartment and box up his stuff.@James II
Jake@And remember the time James saved PB from that contaminated cupcake?@James II
Finn@Yeah, he ate that whole cupcake. What a guy...@James II
Finn@Is this... James heaven?@James II
Jake@Jameses! Alright, who's in charge here?@James II
Finn@James...@James II
James II@Uh, I'm James number 2. The original James got all goopy in the desert.@James II
Jake@Explain this biz, James II.@James II
James II@Well... I was lonely! I knew Princess Bubs would make a new James if, you know, a James died a hero. So...@James II
Finn@You faked your own death?@James II
James II@Yeah! I just wanted a friend. Someone who gets me!@James II
Finn@James...@James II
James II@Plus, each time I get kerplonked, I get another shiny medal, and why have two medals if you can have all the medals? Medals, medals, medals...@James II
Finn@Dude, I've been to your funeral like twenty-five times.@James II
James II@What? The medals make me happy. Plus, PLUS! It's a constant party here in Jamestown!@James II
Jake@PB ain't gonna like this.@James II
Finn@Hmm hmm!@James II
James II@Wait, don't tell her! I'll give you a medal.@James II
Jake@Nah, man. PB's no dummy. She'll find out. It's only a matter of time.@James II
Finn@We like you James but, you're on your own. We're gonna sit this one out.@James II
Finn@This should be good.@James II
Jake@There's Princess Bubblegum!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@Hey! Stop running! You rascals, get back here! You are all in so much trouble! James!@James II
Jake@What a show!@James II
Finn@Very enjoyable!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@Okay, who's the Banana Guard Leader for this week?@James II
Banana Guard Leader@I'm the leader.@James II
Princess Bubblegum@This picture should help you find the Jameses.@James II
Banana Guard Leader@Hey guys, it's the picture of one of the perpetrators. Take a good look.@James II
Banana Guards@Ooooh!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@There's twenty-five of them.@James II
Banana Guard Leader@I need to see the other twenty-four pictures.@James II
Princess Bubblegum@Nope, you only need that one.@James II
Banana Guard Leader@What? How can one picture identify twenty-five perpetrators?@James II
Princess Bubblegum@It's because they all look the same.@James II
Banana Guard Leader@Oh okay, I see. There's twenty-five of them! They all look like this guy!@James II
Banana Guard I@Huh, how can twenty-five guys look like one guy? You mean they're viginti-quintuplets?@James II
Banana Guard Leader@You mean they're viginti-quintuplets?@James II
Princess Bubblegum@No! They're clones.@James II
Banana Guard Leader@What are clones?@James II
Princess Bubblegum@A group of organisms or cells produced asexually from one ancestor or stock, to which they are genetically identical.@James II
Banana Guard II@How did that happen?@James II
Princess Bubblegum@It's a long story.@James II
Banana Guard Leader@I love long stories.@James II
Princess Bubblegum@Aaah! There's no time!@James II
Banana Guard Leader@And they're not brothers?@James II
Princess Bubblegum@No! They're not brothers, they're clones!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@Hey! Get down here and help me! Viginti-quintuplets! I'm telling you...@James II

Banana Guard Leader@Hey you, stop!@James II
Clone James I@Yeah?@James II
Banana Guard Leader@Have you seen this guy?@James II

Banana Guard Leader@Let me see that picture again.@James II
Clone James I@Here you go.@James II
Banana Guard Leader@Hmm... Hmm... What's your name?@James II
Clone James I@James.@James II
Banana Guard Leader@What's your name?@James II
Clone James IV@James.@James II
Clone James V@James.@James II
Clone James VI@James.@James II
Banana Guard Leader@You're all named James. Is it because you guys look alike?@James II
Clone James VI@I guess so.@James II
Banana Guard Leader@Y'know, I was telling this to the guys... If, if we look alike, we should have the same name. It would just make it a little easier. Life, that is. It would make our life a little easier. Aah... Give me a second... Same name... Look alike... You really look alike... Brothers! You're all brothers?@James II
Clone James VI@No... I don't think so.@James II
Banana Guard Leader@One, two, three, four, five, six, seven-@James II
Clone James VI@Twenty-five. If you're counting how many of us look alike, there's twenty-five.@James II
Banana Guard Leader@Hmm... Twenty-five... Not brothers... I think these are the twenty-five that are not brothers. Perpetrators! Get to them!@James II
Banana Guard II@Where they'd go?@James II
The four Banana Guards@It's them!@James II
The four Jameses@Whoop whoop!@James II
Banana Guards@Gotcha!@James II
Jameses@Aww!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@Okay, fun's over. You're not heroes! You don't deserve these medals.@James II
James II@Wah, no fair.@James II
Gumball Guardian@Evil presence detected! Evil!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@Protect the kingdom!@James II
Banana Guards@Okay! Weeoo weeoo weeoo weeoo... Ah! Can't fight!@James II
Finn@Yoink!@James II
Banana Guard@Hey!@James II
Finn@Heeyah!Aww! Don't touch the monsters! They'll melt you! Oh my jerbs! Jake! Let's help these candy orphans! Hey kids!@James II
Gumball Guardian@Evil!@James II
James II@Man, we do deserve them medals. It's not like she can give them to someone else. I wrote my name on all of them.@James II
Clone James@Yeah, so did I.@James II
James II@Princess!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@The original James?@James II
James II@James are a heroes! See? Vrow-w-w-w!@James II
Clone James@Yeah, I'm-a save the day!@James II
Clone James@I, as well!@James II
Clone James@For the good of the many!@James II
Clone James@Check out my selfless act!@James II
Clone James@Me, too! So selfless!@James II
Clone James@All for one, and one for James!@James II
Jake@Mother of Grob!@James II
Jameses@We told you we were heroes!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@I hereby award thee...Jameses...These medals for bravery.@James II
Finn@Dat's my boi, Jameses!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@Now for your new assignment, Jameses. Go unto the Wastelands, and never come back.@James II
Clone James@What-a-wha...?@James II
Princess Bubblegum@Do it, and I'll send you a medal every day.@James II
Jameses@Yay!@James II
Clone James@Come on, every-James!@James II
Jameses@Medals! Medals! Medals! Medals! Medals!@James II
Princess Bubblegum@I'm not gonna miss him.@James II
Finn@Oh! Parm, parm, parm. Asiago's like parm. Whoopsies. Okay, now easy does it.@The Tower
Finn@Ohh!@The Tower
Finn@Thanks a lot, Dad!@The Tower
Jake@Finn? What's going on? Is the spaghetti all—whoa! Finn, what happened?@The Tower
Finn@I... messed up the spaghetti, and then I got mad, and PB's candy arm exploded.@The Tower
Jake@Man, I knew that arm was bogus.@The Tower
Finn@Yeah, it wasn't the greatest. Sorry about the spaghetti, though.@The Tower
Jake@Man, don't worry about that. You just went through some outrageous beeswax from losing your favorite arm and et cetera. You can't just expect to bounce right back to normal.@The Tower
Finn@I can't?@The Tower
Jake@Nah, man. Listen. All these princesses donating all these gross fake arms—they mean well, but they're throwing you off your game! You got to go at your own pace. If you listen deep in your melon heart... that's where the real instructions are.@The Tower
Finn@My melon wants to punch my dad in the face and steal his arm.@The Tower
Jake@Well, those things are bad, so they can't be the real instructions, but you keep listening. Me—I'm going to go to the spaghetti store and buy a new mop head. I'll be back soon. Just remember—listen to your melon heart.@The Tower
Finn@Melon heart... melon heart... man, I don't know. It'd be so easy if I could just go find him—my dad that is. That portal he went through after ripping off my favorite arm went right to outer space. And outer space is up there somewhere... I'm told. Maybe Banana Man could help me build a rocket or something... or some stairs or... something, something, something... or, or, or. Wow, it's like a—like a—like a magic Finn arm. She's powerful. You must've exploded the candy arm before and made the rock pile just know. It's almost like I'm trying to tell myself something, like a message from my melon heart.@The Tower
Princess Bubblegum@Jake, Jake! Oh, I'm so glad you're here.@The Tower
Jake@Afternoon Princess. What's that you're building?@The Tower
Princess Bubblegum@Wait, you don't know?@The Tower
Jake@I might.@The Tower
Princess Bubblegum@Here, look. It was taped to the tower.@The Tower
Jake@Jake, I'm going to space to punch my dad and steal his arm. Back Soon -Finn Wow, what the he?@The Tower
Princess Bubblegum@My biggest powerometer back at the castle was flipping all the way out. It looks like Finn somehow manifested a telekinetic electromagnetic prosthesis.@The Tower
Jake@Word. Word.@The Tower
Princess Bubblegum@With this much raw power he could be a danger to himself or others. So I've quarantined the area till I can coax him down.@The Tower
Jake@Pfft. TMLO Princess.@The Tower
Princess Bubblegum@What does that mean?@The Tower
Jake@That means lay off. Finn's feeling this one out solo style. Give the kid a chance.@The Tower
Finn@Daddy's got an arm and baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad. Baby's building a tower into space. Space is where he's gonna find his dad. Daddy's got an arm and baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad. Baby's building a tower into space. Space is where he's gonna find his dad. Daddy's got an arm, and baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad.@The Tower
Carroll@Ahh!@The Tower
Finn@Oh, hi.@The Tower
Carroll@Get out of my house or I'm going to face blaaaast you.@The Tower
Finn@Hi.@The Tower
Finn@Waah.@The Tower
Carroll@Yep, yeah. I know you. You're one of those swimmers right? A reeeal swim nut.@The Tower
Finn@What? No, I'm Finn.@The Tower
Carroll@Well you can't swim in me. Not anymore, I'm not water. You can't get me up your nooooose.@The Tower
Finn@Okay, I'm going to keep going.@The Tower
Carroll@I'm going to keep going, into here.@The Tower
Finn@Oh, baby's a tower into space. Space where he's gonna find his dad.@The Tower
Jake@Goodnight buddy, I'm proud of you.@The Tower
Finn@Baby's building a tower into space, to tear off his dad's arm. From like where that round of the arm bone meets that weird flat bone on the top of the back. Gonna pull that until it comes off. Baby's building a tower of revenge...@The Tower
Carroll@Hey kid. It's me again. Carroll, my name's Carroll.@The Tower
Finn@Finn.@The Tower
Carroll@Finn, look I'm sorry about blasting you yesterday. Hey man, are you really gonna do those things?@The Tower
Finn@Uh, yeah, for revenge. I think it'll feel good.@The Tower
Carroll@I get it, I get it. But let me tell you something. I used to be water. Like a pond or something real wet. I used to hate people swimming in me, kicking and stuff. So what did I do? I evaporated, I got myself out of there.@The Tower
Finn@You should have pulled off their legs.@The Tower
Carroll@No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, you have to stop obsessing about revenge. Umph. Be like me and run away, you have to run away and never stop hating your old life. You gotta really dwell on it. Ah!@The Tower
Finn@What was that?@The Tower
Carroll@I just thought about my anxieties and it's like my mind hand touched a hot memory stove.@The Tower
Finn@Hmm.@The Tower
Carroll@Ah!@The Tower
Finn@Interesting. Oh hey, what are your thoughts on melon hearts?@The Tower
Carroll@I don't know what you're talking about. Alright then, I guess I'll see you later.@The Tower
BMO@Hey Jake, where's... Where's Finn?@The Tower
Jake@Finn's just working some stuff out, AND IT'S HEALTHY!@The Tower
Princess Bubblegum@It's not healthy, it's bizarre and he could get hurt!@The Tower
Jake@Feelings hurt!@The Tower
Princess Bubblegum@Eeeeah.@The Tower
Jake@Eeeeeeeeeah.@The Tower
BMO@Eeah.@The Tower
Carroll@Finn! Hey what's it like up there? I figured I could turn into spaces, or something.@The Tower
Finn@Daaaad!? Ah. Oh man. My nog master. Hello? Hell-oh! Hey, hey dad?@The Tower
Martin@Huh? Oh good, you're awake.@The Tower
Finn@Gotcha! Ha, ha, hee, hee, hee, hee. Give, give it. Give me the... give me give it. Give me the...@The Tower
Martin@Oh, my favorite arm.@The Tower
Finn@Butts. Butts.@The Tower
Princess Bubblegum@Didn't help much did it.@The Tower
Finn@No. Wait, what?@The Tower
Princess Bubblegum@Bong Bong. Sorry buddy.@The Tower
Finn@PB? Wait, where am I?@The Tower
Princess Bubblegum@We're in the Candy Kingdom fallout shelter. I brought you here after you passed out on the tower. You were hallucinating like crazy so it was really easy to trick you. I figured you'd thank me later after learning your lesson.@The Tower
Finn@Right, right.@The Tower
Princess Bubblegum@And look, the arm is gone too. See? So what do you think?@The Tower
Finn@Hmm. Yeah, okay. Thanks Princess.@The Tower
Jake@Oh, hey buddy you're back. How are you feeling?@The Tower
Finn@Um, neutral I guess. I don't want to punch my dad anymore.@The Tower
Jake@Ha, Ha! That's great! You can always trust the old melon heart to get you through. So I guess we won't be needing this thing anymore. You wanna do the honors?@The Tower
Finn@Yes I do.@The Tower
Princess Bubblegum@MY ARM!!!@The Tower
Neptr@BMO, when is something going to happen?@Sad Face
BMO@Shh. Just watch. It happens once a month—I promise.@Sad Face
BMO@This is it!@Sad Face
Neptr@Oooooh.@Sad Face
Neptr@But where does it go?@Sad Face
BMO@That's none of our business.@Sad Face
Bug@Tickets! Get your tickets here! See the world's greatest tiny circus! Witness the amazing wood-eating termite! The mighty strong-ant!@Sad Face
Ringmaster@You're late, Blue Nose! Get into makeup!@Sad Face
Male audience member@You stink!@Sad Face
Ringmaster@Too much artsy, not enough fartsy. We talked about this, clown! Heh-heh, wasn't that something? Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, you're perfectly safe. But at this time, I'd like to ask anyone with a medical condition to please leave the premises at once. What you're about to witness with your own eyes may shock and astound you to your very core.@Sad Face
Ringmaster@Tonight, I give you the wildest, most dangerous beast anywhere in captivity! The horrible, the stupendous... Goralina!@Sad Face
Ringmaster@Attagirl!@Sad Face
Dad bug@Don't worry, Junior. It's all part of the act.@Sad Face
Ringmaster@Blue Nose! Boy, am I glad to see you. Come in, come in! Sit down. You did good out there tonight with the belly-dancing routine. Real good. Aw, don't give me that look. I know we said we were going to let the chipmunk go at the end of last season, but Goralina is our big draw. You understand that.@Sad Face
Ringmaster@We're barely breaking even here—what do you want from me?! Look, there's another show in an hour. You come up with an act that can rival Goralina, then we can talk. But look what she got us last night three whole pennies. Think you can make me this kind of cash? You do that, I won't need the chipmunk anymore. I'll let her go, just like I promised. But you're gonna have to lose the fancy-schmancy stuff and give the people what they want! Get it?!@Sad Face
Ringmaster@The old Blue Nose magic.@Sad Face
Dad bug@Aren't you glad we came back for the second show?@Sad Face
Ringmaster@Oho! You were great, kid! That's what I'm talking about. With you and the chipmunk in the show, we're gonna have a real one-two punch!@Sad Face
Ringmaster@Hey... I know what I said, but I want to see how many boxcars this gravy train has on it.@Sad Face
Ringmaster@Look at her. It's like looking at a big, sad dollar sign.@Sad Face
Ringmaster@Yipe!@Sad Face
Ringmaster@Whoa-ho!@Sad Face
Strongman@Oh!@Sad Face
Ringmaster@That's right. Lift with your legs first, then put your back into it.@Sad Face
Ringmaster@There he is. Gotcha! Thought you could skip out, eh? and start your own circus!@Sad Face
Strongman@Yeah, you! You and your corny clown hat!@Sad Face
Other performer@Hey, he's smiling!@Sad Face
Strongman@What's so funny?@Sad Face
Other performer@You rat!@Sad Face
Strongman@You creep! What's the big joke?@Sad Face
Neptr@Ha ha! Neat!@Sad Face
Doctor Princess@Hmm....@Breezy
Finn@What is it?@Breezy
Doctor Princess@It's looking droopier.@Breezy
Finn@But I've been pounding pickle juice like I was preggos. For the electrolytes.@Breezy
Doctor Princess@Well, switch back to water. But what I really want to know, is how are you feeling Finn?@Breezy
Finn@What? Oh, I don't know. , I guess I don't feel anything. Bleh.@Breezy
Doctor Princess@Okay, that's what I thought. You gotta bounce back, man. You got burned by your bad dad, you lost your arm, and all the ladies say you don't talk to Flame Princess no more.@Breezy
Finn@Who's sayin' that?@Breezy
Doctor Princess@Finn, flowers thrive on good vibes. As your doctor, I'm ordering you to go out and have fun, okay?@Breezy
Finn@You want to go with me to Crab Princess' party tonight?@Breezy
Doctor Princess@Uh, what? Like... as a date?@Breezy
Finn@Sure. That would be fun, right?@Breezy
Doctor Princess@Finn, I don't date my patients.@Breezy
Finn@It's cool. Guess I'll go make out with Crab Princess.@Breezy
Doctor Princess@Okay. Tell her I said "hi".@Breezy
Finn@♪I'm lost in the darkness, what will this bring? Autumn descends on me,Autumn♪@Breezy
Breezy@♪What do I see? Oh, so beautiful. My heart it beats. Oh, so magical.♪@Breezy
Finn@♪I'm lost in the darkness, what will this bring?♪@Breezy
Lumpy Space Princess@Aah! Watch it, Crab Princess!@Breezy
Crab Princess@I'm sorry.@Breezy
Lumpy Space Princess@You ain't my man, so why are you all up in my lumps?!@Breezy
Raggedy Princess@Hey, Finn, could you pour this juice into my mouth?@Breezy
Finn@What? Pfft! Aah!@Breezy
Raggedy Princess@I can't reach my juice.@Breezy
Finn@Yo, come on bee! Geez!@Breezy
Breezy@Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize—@Breezy
Finn@Didn't realize what? That there's a person attached to this flower?@Breezy
Breezy@Uh, yes. I'm sorry. But it's only because your flower's the greatest miracle of all time. It's just doing something to me, I—@Breezy
Finn@Oh, that's cool. Thanks, beezy.@Breezy
Breezy@My name's Breezy.@Breezy
Raggedy Princess@Never mind, Finn.@Breezy
Breezy@So uh, what are you doing here? Heh.@Breezy
Finn@Ah, well, I came here to make out with Crab Princess, but I sort of lost steam on the walk over. I don't know what crabs are into. I'm just gonna stop trying and let my flower wilt away. Who cares?@Breezy
Breezy@I'll try for you, man.@Breezy
Finn@Whoa! Really?@Breezy
Breezy@Yeah! I'm gonna help you, friend.@Breezy
Crab Princess@Hey, Emerald Princess, you know what would blow this party up?@Breezy
Emerald Princess@What?@Breezy
Crab Princess@If we all got in a line and just showed off our moves.@Breezy
Lumpy Space Princess@Yeah! Do it! Oh, my glob! Aah ha ha! Haa!@Breezy
Crab Princess@Thanks for walking me home, Finn. I'd invite you over, but you can't breathe underwater, right?@Breezy
Finn@Not usually, but can I have a kiss, please?@Breezy
Crab Princess@Uh, okay...@Breezy
Finn@Okay. Good night, Crab Princess.@Breezy
Crab Princess@Good night, Finn!@Breezy
Breezy@Hey, you did it!@Breezy
Finn@Oh, you're still here.@Breezy
Breezy@Yeah, just checking in... on my buddy. So, how you feelin', buddy?@Breezy
Finn@Pretty grease. I made out with Crab Princess, so that's grease. But really I don't feel nothing. Maybe if I made out, I will feel something? Maybe I'll reach a "good vibe" saturation point. And then my flower will feel good, too...@Breezy
Breezy@Your flower feels good, yes.@Breezy
Finn@Hey, cut it out, Breezy.@Breezy
Breezy@Ha ha! I'm just messin' around. We're buddies, right?@Breezy
Finn@Yeah, Breezy, I like you. You're a good wingman.@Breezy
Breezy@Yeah, wingman. I'm a girl, but all right! Let's wingman you some make-outs!@Breezy
Jake@Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!@Breezy
Finn@What's up with your head?@Breezy
Jake@Eh, I'm trying something new. Hey, how's it going, miss...?@Breezy
Frozen Yogurt Princess@Frozen Yogurt Princess.@Breezy
Jake@Whoa. You're a dead ringer for Flame Princess, with a smidge of Princess Bubblegum mixed in. Guess you're still hung up on both of 'em, bro.@Breezy
Finn@I ain't hung up on nobody! Nobody. Breezy, let's get out of here.@Breezy
Breezy@Okay.@Breezy
Finn@She doesn't look anything like Flame Princess, does she?@Breezy
Breezy@I don't know who that is.@Breezy
Finn@Exactly. I'm just trying to have fun. You know, doctor's orders. But I still ain't feelin' nothing. maybe I should just let this poor flower die.@Breezy
Breezy@Noooo... Listen, buddy, being a free spirit is fun and all, but you got a responsibility to that flower, just like I got a responsibility. Get this—I'm actually a virgin queen bee. I was born to lead a hive, destined for a life of obligation and ritual.@Breezy
Finn@Whoa. Bummer.@Breezy
Breezy@Yes. Once I drink of the royal jelly, my carefree days are done.@Breezy
Finn@Dang. That sounds like raw deez. Breezy, you got to stay free... Free to make out with whatevs.@Breezy
Breezy@Yeah, maybe you're right. You know, it's too bad we're such great buddies or we could make out with each other.@Breezy
Finn@What?@Breezy
Breezy@Uh, nothing. Come on, pal! Lets run and be free.@Breezy
Breezy@Whoops! I tripped right into you@Breezy
Breezy@That's right. Everybody's havin' fun...@Breezy
Finn@Whoops!@Breezy
Both@Whoa!@Breezy
Bee Person@What's that?@Breezy
Bee Person@Mnh-mnh! Hey, girl! Girl, I know you can hear me!@Breezy
Bee Person@Girl, get back to your hive! Quit hanging out with that bologna tube! It's disgusting!@Breezy
Finn@Mnh-mnh. Yo! Shut it! She's an independent lady!@Breezy
Breezy@Yeah, shut it!@Breezy
Bee Person@A'ight! Hey! You guys want to roast a wiener?@Breezy
Other Bee People@Yeah!@Breezy
Bee Person@Gonna teach you to mind your b's and q's, chump! Buzzzzz!@Breezy
Finn@Uh! Run, Breezy!@Breezy
Finn@Aah!@Breezy
Bee Person@You're about to get waggle-danced, you chicken! Unh!@Breezy
Finn@Ow! Ooh!@Breezy
Breezy@Oh, no! Flower! I-I mean Finn!@Breezy
Breezy@aha! Don't worry, Finn! I jacked some royal jelly from their hive!@Breezy
Finn@Breezy... No!@Breezy
Breezy@Aaaah.@Breezy
Breezy@Hey, honeybuns!@Breezy
Bee Person@Whoa! Oh, No! She got into our secret sauce, bro! It's all over! Long live the queen!@Breezy
Finn@Breezy?@Breezy
Breezy@Yes, Finn. Can't you see? I've become a queen to save you because... I love your flower and—and I think... I love you! Now you can partake of my pollen crumbles and become my drone.@Breezy
Finn@Um... You know, I'm—I'm trying to keep it casual, B. I just don't feel the same way. I don't feel anything.@Breezy
Breezy@But I royal jellied for you.@Breezy
Finn@I'm lost in the darkness, Breezy.@Breezy
Lumpy Space Princess@Finn. Finn. I saw this already! I know all about your dirty deeds. Now it's Lumpy's turn to slump those lips! Bring it in, baby.@Breezy
Lumpy Space Princess@Wha? Where you going?@Breezy
Finn@That's it. We made out.@Breezy
Lumpy Space Princess@Wha—What?! I didn't wait infinity for a dip in the kiddie pool! We're taking this to the deep end!@Breezy

Candy Children@Whoa-a-a!@Food Chain

Candy Child 3@Come on! Come on!@Food Chain
Candy children@Wow! Yay! Whee!@Food Chain
Candy Child@Whoa-a-a!@Food Chain
Finn@Hmm. Why would I need to learn about caterpillar families? I don't get it.@Food Chain
Jake@Well, they look like they're having fun.@Food Chain
Finn@Real leaves aren't made out of candy. They always have a gross, bitter taste.@Food Chain
Candy Child@Whee!@Food Chain
Candy Child (Terry)@Terry eats all the caterpillars!@Food Chain
Candy Child 2@Mmm! Ah, it's so good!@Food Chain
Finn@Ugh. That's gross, too. There's no way real caterpillars are delicious.@Food Chain
Jake@You think? I bet they taste great if you're a boid.@Food Chain
Princess Bubblegum@The caterpillar eats the leaf. Then the bird eats the caterpillar. Then the big bird eats the little bird. The big bird then dies, and its remains decompose into rich, fertile soil And from that soil, a new plant bursts to life. And then the caterpillar eats the plant again. And so the circle of life continues. This is a law of nature we call the food chain.@Food Chain
Princess Bubblegum@Isn't that fascinating?@Food Chain
Candy Child (Terry)@Yo, Princess Bubblegum, do birds play football?@Food Chain
Princess Bubblegum@No, Terry. They don't.@Food Chain
Candy Child (Terry)@That's weak, Ma'am.@Food Chain
Candy Child 2@You guys, this is lame.@Food Chain

Finn@It's okay. It's okay. Just give it a try. It's a new experience, right?@Food Chain
Jake@Wow, you have a lot of saliva. You must have a broken pipe, old timer. It's comfy, though.@Food Chain
Jake@Whoa! Did you just try to eat me?!@Food Chain
Finn@No...? But if I did that'd be okay, right?@Food Chain
Jake@You are trying to eat me.@Food Chain
Finn@I'm just following the Law of Nature.@Food Chain
Jake@What're you talking about?@Food Chain
Finn@I don't know. I just feel that way.@Food Chain
Finn@Aw, Jake, you're missing out... by not getting eaten... by me.@Food Chain
Jake@Sorry, man. I'm not into it.@Food Chain
Finn@So alone. So hungry. The Law of Nature... has claimed this... bod...@Food Chain
Finn@Yay! What a big turnout. Top notch! To decompose stuff! Yeah-h-h! We are so pumped! Yeah! What's that smell?@Food Chain
Finn@Wow. It looks amazing! Yay! Yay!@Food Chain
Finn@Party time!@Food Chain
Finn@So good! Awesome. This bird went bad so well!@Food Chain
Jake@You took it too far, man. I'm a dog, and I eat all kinds of horrible things. This is disgusting.@Food Chain
Finn@Come on, think of it as a conversation starter—like, "The other night, I ate the grossest thing I've ever tasted." You know, it's interesting. @Food Chain
Finn@Whew! I'm full.@Food Chain
Finn@Whoa! Aah!@Food Chain
Finn@Whoa! Aah! Whoa! Aah! What's going on?! Whoa!@Food Chain
Finn@I think we're safe now... and also caterpillars.@Food Chain
Jake@We're still in a bind, man. No food, no water.@Food Chain
Finn@I'm hungry.@Food Chain
Jake@I'm thirsty.@Food Chain
Jake@Hey, look.@Food Chain
Jake@It's another caterpillar.@Food Chain
Jake@Huh? You okay?@Food Chain
Finn@She's beautiful.@Food Chain
Jake@She's just a caterpillar, dude.@Food Chain
Jake@Looks like she's gonna faint.@Food Chain
Jake@You see?@Food Chain
Jake@Huh. "Love is Blind"—that must apply to all species.@Food Chain
Jake@Oh, I see. Your name is Erin, and there's a famine near your town, so that's why you're out here searching for an oasis.@Food Chain
Erin@Yes, I have to hurry and find food. Otherwise, my family won't survive. But I don't know if I can go on...@Food Chain
Finn@Hold on, Erin. Food! Water! Shade! Where are you?!@Food Chain
Jake@Over there—the oasis!@Food Chain
Finn@Yummy!@Food Chain
Jake@Really? You like leaves now?@Food Chain
Finn@So good, dude.@Food Chain
Finn@Your eyes.@Food Chain
Jake@Hey, hey, hey, move over a bit. I got a rhythm going here.@Food Chain
Erin@I've never been this happy.@Food Chain
Jake@This oasis is pretty romantic, huh?@Food Chain
Erin@Sure, I guess.@Food Chain
Jake@So, how many kids you want to have?@Food Chain
Finn@Uh, d-d-do you want to get married?@Food Chain
Erin@Yes!@Food Chain
Jake@And will you, Finn, take this caterpillar to be your wife, even if she becomes a flower or a bird or a bacteria, to love and to cherish till death do you part?@Food Chain
Finn@Y-y-y-yes.@Food Chain
Jake@You may now kiss the bride.@Food Chain
Finn@This way, Erin!@Food Chain
Caterpillar@Hey, is that my butt? Man, it's been a while!@Food Chain
Erin@Finn!@Food Chain
Finn@When we're reborn as caterpillars, I'll marry you all over again!@Food Chain
Erin@That's beautiful, Finn! But when we're bacteria, I might see other people!@Food Chain
Jake@Hey, why are you eating caterpillars?@Food Chain
Finn@My eyes are open.@Food Chain
Princess Bubblegum@The caterpillar eats the leaf. Then the bird eats the caterpillar. Then the big bird eats the little bird then dies and its remains decompose into rich, fertile soil. And from that soil, a new plant bursts to life. And then the caterpillar eats the plant again. And so the circle of life continues.@Food Chain
Candy Child 2@Eh, so what? Let's go play.@Food Chain

Candy Person@Crunchy, chill. Chill.@Something Big
Maja@Keepers of the clock, masters of dimension, bear witness!@Something Big
Maja@By my power, I compel you to converge!@Something Big
Maja@Past and present, be one. Awaken the terror of a forgotten age in this moment that is all moments in the blink of an eye.@Something Big
Maja@Darren, the ancient sleeper, arise!@Something Big
Darren@I had a dream I was fighting an army that could birth new soldiers from their own blood. I was endless. Does that make sense?@Something Big
Maja@Yes. You want to go conquer the Candy Kingdom?@Something Big
Darren@What's that?@Something Big
Maja@It's a place that contains the highest levels of caring and sentimental affection in all of Ooo.@Something Big
Darren@What is caring? What kind of world is this?@Something Big
Maja@It's a feeling I use in my magic to give me power. Like this shirt that was once the prized possession of Princess Bubblegum. With the feelings in this shirt, I was able to summon you.@Something Big
Darren@I don't—walk me through this.@Something Big
Maja@All right.@Something Big
Darren@This kingdom of candy...@Something Big
Maja@Yes?@Something Big
Darren@I will lay it to waste, turn their people to salt.@Something Big
Maja@Yeah...@Something Big
Darren@And garnish a million meals with the salt, which we will eat for eternity.@Something Big
Maja@That's not my plan exactly, but you'll be fine. I promise.@Something Big
Darren@I promise, as well, to deliver destruction so thorough that all realities are affected.@Something Big
Maja@Okay. We'll talk about that.@Something Big
Darren@All realities.@Something Big
Maja@Hey! We'll talk about it!@Something Big
Maja@Break this witch out, Darren.@Something Big
Princess Bubblegum@How long will your force field hold, Gridface Princess?@Something Big
Gridface Princess@The sleeper's magic is older than legend. I don't know how he disabled both Gumball Guardians, but at least I know my tech is tight. The field will hold long enough for you to think of a weak plan.@Something Big
Princess Bubblegum@Colonel Candy Corn?@Something Big
Colonel Candy Corn@Uh, yes, Princess.@Something Big
Princess Bubblegum@Ready the cannons. You got me? If they get through that barrier, I don't want to have to use our ground troops.@Something Big
Colonel Candy Corn@Will do, Princess. And let me just say... thank you for putting this old crease back in the field. I haven't been the same since my lovely Linda passed away.@Something Big
Princess Bubblegum@Yeah. Good luck.@Something Big
Colonel Candy Corn@Oh, I tried dating again, you know? But these young girls think I'm too serious or something.@Something Big
Peppermint Butler@Why don't you date someone your own age?@Something Big
Princess Bubblegum@Peppermint Butler, come on!@Something Big
Colonel Candy Corn@Oh, women my age don't hang out. Where are they hiding?@Something Big
Colonel Candy Corn@I need a young girl with an old soul to heal my heart.@Something Big
Darren@This is taking too long.@Something Big
Maja@Then do the thing!@Something Big
Darren@I call forth the Legion of Cadmus, the Dragon's Teeth!@Something Big
Colonel Candy Corn@What am I supposed to—oh! Party's starting. Load 'em up, soldiers!@Something Big
Candy soldier@Yeah, just put it in there. I don't know.@Something Big
Colonel Candy Corn@Oh, dang!@Something Big
Colonel Candy Corn@Fire!@Something Big
Princess Bubblegum@Finn and Jake, are you ready to—what the...? Finn? Where the jam is Finn?!@Something Big
Banana Guard@I don't know. Weren't they just here?@Something Big
Princess Bubblegum@What the jam?!@Something Big
Princess Bubblegum@All right. Finn or no Finn, PB's got to get in that biz. Hyah!@Something Big
Colonel Candy Corn@Why have you stopped firing?@Something Big
Candy soldier@We ran out of ammo, colonel.@Something Big
Colonel Candy Corn@That's nonsense, soldier.@Something Big
Colonel Candy Corn@This is how you defend your kingdom! Fire, you wimps! Ya-ha!@Something Big
Candy soldiers@Ah!@Something Big
Colonel Candy Corn@For the kingdom!@Something Big
Candy soldiers@For the king...@Something Big
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, zang!@Something Big
Candy soldiers@...ingdom!@Something Big
Maja@Eat it, tranch!@Something Big
Darren@It's over, Princess. Prepare to be annihilated across all dimensions.@Something Big
Colonel Candy Corn@Princess! No!@Something Big
Maja@Wait, Darren! Dial it back. I need her residual feelings.@Something Big
Darren@What the flip is feelings? Darren only understands life and death!@Something Big
Darren@Wah!@Something Big
Maja@What the slizz?!@Something Big
Finn & Jake@Yeah, boy!@Something Big
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant@Hi, Darren.@Something Big
Maja@The Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant?!@Something Big
Darren@Eli, were you asleep forever too? All this stuff is different now. What are we even doing here?@Something Big
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant@Yes, it's been a difficult adjustment.@Something Big
Finn@Blaze his face, Eli!@Something Big
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant@Yes, master.@Something Big
Ice King@Yo! Leave me out of it!@Something Big
Maja@No!@Something Big
Darren@Yeah, right.@Something Big
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant@Finn, his weakness is his brain seed.@Something Big
Finn@Okay!@Something Big
Finn@Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!@Something Big
Finn@Oh, uh! Aah!@Something Big
Darren@Thank you.@Something Big
Jake@Whoa!@Something Big
Banana Guard@Well, I guess my kids still have a daddy.@Something Big
Colonel Candy Corn@Bam, you dope!@Something Big
Princess Bubblegum@Party tonight in the Candy Kingdom!@Something Big
Princess Bubblegum@Hey, where's Finn?@Something Big
Finn@Hi.@Something Big
Princess Bubblegum@Okay. Y'all bring food and bevs. Finn, you make the guac, all right?@Something Big
Finn@I'll make the guaaaaaaaaaaac.@Something Big
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant@Finn! Finn!@Something Big
Finn@Yo! What's up, APTWE?@Something Big
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant@What do I do now?@Something Big
Finn@Dude, I don't know. Probably not go back in the basement. You're so big'uns. You should be free, boy.@Something Big
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant@Free to do what? I need psychic commands.@Something Big
Finn@Can you help me dice tomatoes for this guac?@Something Big
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant@No.@Something Big
Finn@You see, man, I feel weird giving you orders. You should just do your own thing. Realize your potential.@Something Big
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant@But this is what I am—a war machine who serves its master.@Something Big
Finn@No, man. You're more than that. Whoops. I see into your brain, remember? You'll do great. Just go for it. I believe in you, man.@Something Big
Finn@Oh, word. Thanks.@Something Big
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant@Maybe Darren was right. There's no place for my ancient ways.@Something Big
Finn@Don't think like that, dude! Come back and see us whenevs!@Something Big
Ant@I'm doing this for a reason. What choice is there?@Something Big
Baby birds@Hungry! Hungry! Hungry!@Something Big
Mama bird@Must feed babies.@Something Big
Sun@Hey! Elephant. I'm more ancient than you. Someday, I will engulf the solar system. What was and what will be are meaningless. Meanwhile, you should wonder are you just a two-headed pile of meat on a crash course with the cosmic dump? Or do you contain the soul memory of a million dead stars? How do you light a candle without a match?@Something Big
Maja@Hello? Who's that? Why can't I see jack?@Something Big
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant@You bonked your head. You're in a coma, but I can help.@Something Big
Maja@Um, all right. Are you, like, powerful?@Something Big
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant@Yes. I can fly and do lasers from my nose.@Something Big
Maja@Okay. I can run with this. Take me to the Candy Kingdom and shoot your laser nose at it.@Something Big
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant@No. I must decide, in this moment, what is best. For now, I am the match and the candle.@Something Big
Maja@What?@Something Big
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant@I will be your friend and keep you alive, until you regain consciousness, maybe.@Something Big
Maja@Ugh, that plan sounds like dirt!@Something Big
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant@See through my eyes, Maja.@Something Big
Maja@Ah! It's bright! Wait! You're the flippin' elephant! You laser-nosed me! Somebody help! Oh, my Glob. Somebody!@Something Big
Leaf@Well, this wasn't part of my plan.@Something Big
Caterpillar@Hey, man. I'm gonna eat you.@Something Big
Voice@Whoo, show me them legs!@Little Brother
Jake@Shelby?@Little Brother
Shelby@Hey, Dancing Bug! Uh, come on, man. Shake it.@Little Brother
Pincer Beetle@No. I really couldn't—Okay! Maybe I could!@Little Brother
Scorpion@Whoa, dang, DB. You're the best bug at this party!@Little Brother
Shelby@What? Hey, I got moves, too, guys.@Little Brother
Scorpion@Yeah, right, Shelby. What are you gonna do? The Worm?@Little Brother
Shelby@No. I'm gonna do parkour.@Little Brother
Scorpion@Hmm.@Little Brother
Shelby@Haha! Parkour! Ah, oh no. I really hurt myself. Guys, I'm so dumb!@Little Brother
Shelby@Ugh. Hey, somebody forgot their—oh, cram! Um...who are you?@Little Brother
Kent@Pbht!@Little Brother
Shelby@Oh. There's-There's a note. "Hey, dude, the tip of your tail got snipped off, so now you have a little brother. We named him Butty Butterson. Signed, the other bugs." I'll call you Kent for short.@Little Brother
Shelby@Jake..Jake!@Little Brother
Jake@Hmm? Whoa, Shelby! What's going on there? With your butt?@Little Brother
Shelby@It's fine. I was goofing off, got hurt. Now I got a little brother. I named him Kent.@Little Brother
Kent@I'm Kent!@Little Brother
Shelby@Whoa! A talking brother.@Little Brother
Jake@You can chop up a worm and get two? I thought that was a myth.@Little Brother
Shelby@Myth is a powerful force in my life, dude. So the thing is, I don't know beans about being a big brother. Can you give me some tips?@Little Brother
Jake@Ah, it's easy. You just give him something sharp and get him to fight bad guys.@Little Brother
Shelby@That's it?@Little Brother
Jake@Yeah, you might have to stretch all big if he gets in real trouble. But, yeah.@Little Brother
Shelby@Alright. Sounds good.@Little Brother
Kent@Someday, you'll be Kent's food.@Little Brother
Kent@Oh wow.@Little Brother
Shelby@Hey, how'd you do that?@Little Brother
Kent@I don't know.@Little Brother
Shelby@Hmm. Okay, Kent. This is real important. You're my little brother, so your purpose is to fight bad guys. So go fight some bad guys. Or girls. Don't discriminate.@Little Brother
Kent@Oh. Okay, brother. Boo-oop. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!@Little Brother
Kent@Hyah! A bad guy. Ah! Let's fight! Aaah! Hey, get back here! Don't run! I'm super new at fights. And at being alive.@Little Brother
Dewdrop@Hi.@Little Brother
Kent@Who are you? Where am I? Why do my parts hurt?@Little Brother
Leaf Beard@Oh, good, you're awake. I am Leaf Beard. I found you blonked out and bruised in the tunnels. But if you drink of our dewdrops, it will fix up all your ouchies.@Little Brother
Kent@Pbht!@Little Brother
Leaf Beard@The rat king has made his way to our end of the roots. You should be more careful.@Little Brother
Kent@Oh. Oh, okay. What's a rat king?@Little Brother
Leaf Beard@Oh. You're not from the roots.@Little Brother
Kent@I'm from my brother's butt. Maybe.@Little Brother
Leaf Beard@The rat king's been destroying our home, chewing up the roots of this tree. This tree that gives us life!@Little Brother
Guy@Hey!@Little Brother
Kent@So, he's a bad guy?@Little Brother
Leaf Beard@So sick, nasty bad.@Little Brother
Kent@That means I got to fight him. That's what my brother said to do! Where's my sword?@Little Brother
Leaf Beard@Your sword was shattered to butts when I found you.@Little Brother
Kent@Oh...bummer.@Little Brother
Leaf Beard@Yes. Bums.@Little Brother
Kent@What do I do?@Little Brother
Leaf Beard@Um...I don't know. But the blacksmith could make you a new one, probably.@Little Brother
Dewdrop@That's who I am. And I am very good at me. Okay, so, like, the rat king has been messing up the roots, yeah? Chewing on them with his teeth. The sword has to be made with the strongest tree stuff so even his teeth can't break it! Bring me the freshest ingredients and I'll do it up.@Little Brother
Kent@Boo! Cool, cool.@Little Brother
Mouse Wizard@Greetings.@Little Brother
Kent@Hey, man. I'm looking for some unbreakable ore. Y'all got that here?@Little Brother
Mouse Wizard@I have what you seek. But consider this instead. I offer you this treasure of glittering emeralds. You'll be infinitely rich and live the rest of your days in comfort.@Little Brother
Kent@No, I'm good. Just the ore, please.@Little Brother
Mouse Wizard@Oh, ho! Well done! By resisting the temptation of wealth, you have passed my test.@Little Brother
Kent@Nah, I just don't care about money. My name's Kent. I'm supposed to fight bad guys.@Little Brother
Mouse Wizard@Alright. That's pretty weird, but...here you go. The unbreakable ore. Uh... Uh..you can just—yeah. Oh, there, there she goes.@Little Brother
Kent@Ha, ha! Boop, boop, ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop, boop, boop, boop. Whoop, whoop!@Little Brother
Mouse Knight@Greetings. Come to fight me, eh?@Little Brother
Kent@My name is Kent, and if I had a sword I'd totally fight you. But for now, I'm looking for a clod of mystic earth.@Little Brother
Mouse Knight@Yes. I have what you seek. But consider this instead. I offer you the hand of one of my beautiful daughters. You'll become a good husband and live the rest of your days in true love.@Little Brother
Kent@Nah, I don't care about being a good husband or wife or whatever. All's I care about is fighting bad guys.@Little Brother
Mouse Knight@Dang, homes. That's cold. Here you go. Mystic earth.@Little Brother
Mouse Thief@Greetings.@Little Brother
Kent@Dude, you know why I'm here!@Little Brother
Mouse Thief@Yeah. And I got what you want. But consider this instead. Hiya! Drink this sap, and you'll have life eternal. You'll never meet death and you'll outlast the world.@Little Brother
Kent@Um...I was born earlier today, so I don't really get a sense of my own mortality. No, thank you.@Little Brother
Mouse Thief@Hyah! The sacred flame.@Little Brother
Dewdrop@Oh, what?@Little Brother
Kent@I name this sword..Punch Party! I feel so cool right now. It's party time. Whoa! Uh!@Little Brother
Rat King@Greetings.@Little Brother
Kent@Who's there?@Little Brother
Rat King@I am the rat king. Why are you here?@Little Brother
Kent@I-I've got, like, this rad sword, and...I'm gonna fight you with it. Yes!@Little Brother
Rat King@Who are you fighting me for? Your brother?@Little Brother
Kent@What?@Little Brother
Rat King@Instead, why don't you join me? I offer you cosmic power. You'll be a king and live the rest of your days as a god.@Little Brother
Kent@You're messing up the tree, and I totally live here! You're a bad guy!@Little Brother
Rat King@Yeah.@Little Brother
Kent@Don't do that!@Little Brother
Rat King@How do you plan to defeat me?@Little Brother
Kent@I'm...making...this...up...as I go!@Little Brother
Shelby@Having a brother around looks kind of fun. Where are you? Little Brother? Are you happy? Or do you feel weird? Have you changed a lot? Or not? Are you ever gonna come back here? I shouldn't have been so hasty. You were just a little baby. Or maybe you weren't. I'm not really sure how little brothers work.@Little Brother
Kent@You were the first friend I ever had.@Little Brother
Both@No one can compare. Together we could probably fight a bear. So if you're ever sad/lonely, don't be, 'cause I'll be right here next to you. 'Cause that's what big brothers are supposed to do.@Little Brother
Shelby@Whoa! Kent proceeded his fantastic journey to me. It was all super good. But he had also partaken of the food of the underworld, and so he was compelled to return there by dewdrop law. That's what he said, at least. Maybe he was having second thoughts about infinite riches, true love, and eternal life. Or maybe he had just decided that fighting bad guys wasn't really his deal. But I do know this—free from the rat king's cursed teeth, that spring, for the first time in many years, the willow tree was in bloom.@Little Brother
T.V.@Ugh. I'm covered in noobs.@Ocarina
Lady Rainicorn@T.V., 잘 지내니? (How are you?)@Ocarina
T.V.@I've got hunger cranks.@Ocarina
Viola@Hmm? Oh, yes. That's very interesting.@Ocarina
T.V.@Kim Kil Whan.@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Hm.@Ocarina
T.V.@Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraahh! Mom, when are we gonna eat?! I'm going nuts!@Ocarina
Lady Rainicorn@T.V., 말조심해! (Watch your mouth!)@Ocarina
Jake Jr.@Seriously, Mom, Dad's already three hours late with the food!@Ocarina
Viola@You hush, Junior. You know Dad's a wonderful cook.@Ocarina
Jake Jr.@Viola, when's the last time you even heard from Dad?@Ocarina
Viola@Oh, you know. Dad is... distractible.@Ocarina
Jake Jr.@"Distractible"!@Ocarina
T.V.@Yeah, I love Dad and everything, but he's only ever met me twice.@Ocarina
Lady Rainicorn@Charlie, Viola, T.V., Jake Jr., Kim Kil Whan, 제발! 너네 아빠가 너를 얼마나 보고 싶어하는데. (Please! Your dad really wants to see you.)@Ocarina
Finn & Jake@Whoo!@Ocarina
Finn@Whoo! Whoo-hoo!@Ocarina
Jake@Yeah, yeah, yeah! We're real late! Happy birthday, puppies! Okay, so, putting it out there—I didn't remember to bring you guys any birthday presents, but I did bring lunch! It's macaroni salad.@Ocarina
Viola@Dad, you're beautiful!@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Dad! We have new business to discuss.@Ocarina
Jake@Happy birthday, Kim Kil Whan.@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Birthdays are old business.@Ocarina
Jake@Whoa, neat. Um, well, how are things going, Son?@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@"Things"? "Things" have switched hands.@Ocarina
Jake@Heh. I get it.@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Dad, when I say that things have switched hands, I mean to say that things you have previously claimed ownership of have transferred from your hands to my hands, in that... I bought your tree house.@Ocarina
Jake@What?!@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@What the deed to your tree house. How acquired through legal trade. From whom the deed's previous owner, Marceline The Vampire Queen... in exchange for one lunatic bass.@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@When effective immediately.@Ocarina
Jake@But, Son, why?@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@We will convene at the property.@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Sorry I'm late. Okay. So, as the deed holder of this tree house, I am now your landlord. The first thing I'm going to have to do is assess your treasure room.@Ocarina
Jake@But, Son, I'm your pop. What would your mother say, doing this to your poor pip-pop?@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@I'm sorry, Dad. Deeds don't bleed.@Ocarina
Jake@Okay, Son, get ready to be glitter-stunned by all this treasu—oh, yeah. We spent all of it. All we have left are these vintage photos I got at the flea market. They're interesting!@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Woof. Alright, so I guess this is the apartment the two of you can afford. It's a ladder. Yeah? Yeah. Send them on over. Sorry about that. Anyway, as you can see, this beauty offers direct first- and second-floor access, superb craftsmanship, and et cetera. I... suppose you're familiar. Yes, Finn?@Ocarina
Finn@Yeah, uh, when do we get our house back?@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@What?@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Excuse me. Good afternoon. Yes, right this way. I've got 37 available units to show in this building, so we're gonna want to get right to it. Please step inside. There we go. Is that everyone? Good, good. Please make your way upstairs, and we'll begin the tour. And, you two, go ahead and make yourselves at home. Rent's due on the 1st. No overnight guests. Oh, and flush once after you boom-boom but before you start using the TP, and then once more in the middle of using the TP if you're going to use a lot. It's... easier on the pipes. Okay, call me if you need me.@Ocarina
Jake@Hey, Finn, I'm real sorry about this. Somehow, I feel like it's kind of my fault.@Ocarina
Finn@Nah, man. It's really not so bad. Let's just sleep on it tonight.@Ocarina
Jake@You're gonna sleep like that?@Ocarina
Finn@Yeah, man. It's tough. I'm a tough kid.@Ocarina
Jake@I promise I'll work this thi—@Ocarina
Long-legged tenant@Gee, but it's great to be back home, eh, Mr. B?@Ocarina
Mr. B@Ah, yeah. I can't wait to wash my gross, fat butt.@Ocarina
Finn@Ugh!@Ocarina
Gnome tenant@Oh, oh, holy cow. Oh! Oh, boy, please hurry. Yes, he's inside my apartment right now. Oh, I'm so scared.@Ocarina
Jake@Hey, buddy, you okay?@Ocarina
Gnome tenant@Glob, now there's two of 'em!@Ocarina
Jake@I just feel like if we're patient, this whole thing will work itself out before you know it.@Ocarina
Jake@See, man? Help is on the way.@Ocarina
Finn@Man, can I tell you something? I don't even know what's going on, here. I mean, like, what the heck is a deed? How come he can buy our house when it's our house and Marceline gave it to us and we live there?! A-and now we're arrested? This is crazy! It's crazy!!@Ocarina
Jake@Man, don't you know? The laws ain't made to help earthy cats like us.@Ocarina
Finn@They're not?@Ocarina
Jake@Nah, man. Listen. Here on our planet, back in the old days—back in the real old days—it was just every man for hisself, scrooblin' and scrat-scrobblin' for the good stuff, the greenest valleys, and scrat-scrobblin'. And the strongest, meanest men got the best stuff. They got the green valleys and were like, "The rest of you, y'all scrats get sand." And that's when they made the laws, you see. Once the strong guys got it how they like it, they said, "This is fair now. This is the law." Once they were winning, they changed the rules up.@Ocarina
Finn@Whoa, just like Kim Kil Whan.@Ocarina
Banana Guard@Hey, good news, fellas. You bail's paid. You're free to go.@Ocarina
Jake@That's awesome!@Ocarina
Finn@Yeah! Awesome!@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Yeah, real "awesome."@Ocarina
Jake@Hey, Kim Kil Whan! Aw, buddy, I knew you'd come around. Fathers and sons, man. That's that real thick chowder. What's this?@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@This is a bill for the bail I just paid.@Ocarina
Jake@Ooh.@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@You're really in it deep, here, Dad. It's time for you to get real. Get a job. No more games.@Ocarina
Jake@Come on, Son, just let me do the... lah blah blah blah blah.@Ocarina
Jake@Man, where did I go wrong?@Ocarina
Finn@I don't know, but I'm not tryin' to be sleepin' on a ladder anymore, so let's just get a bunch of scroot together and buy our house back. Then you two can hash it out later.@Ocarina
Jake@Yeah, you're right. So, wanna rob a bank or somethin'?@Ocarina
Finn@Well, actually, I was thinking maybe Kim Kil Whan was right. Maybe we should get jobs or somethin'.@Ocarina
Jake@Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, no, wait! I just remembered I buried a ton of gold in the front yard!@Ocarina
Finn@Yes!@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Oh, yes, yes, absolutely. Small pets are allowed with an additional deposit.@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Excellent.@Ocarina
Finn@Watch it!@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Excuse me.@Ocarina
Jake@Almost got it.@Ocarina
Jake@Hey, Son. I'm glad you're here.@Ocarina
Finn@Bad news, ya scrat! We're buying our house back!@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Oh, yeah? With what?@Ocarina
Jake@With this!@Ocarina
Finn@Yeah!@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Oh, I see. With the gold you dug out of my lawn, which is therefore mine. Now, since I have a job, I must be going. Ciao. And fill in that hole.@Ocarina
Finn@I'm gonna be frank, here. Your son's a real-time jingle-blaster.@Ocarina
Jake@I know, I know. Kim Kil Whan's a real out-loud flim-flammer, and that's okay, I guess, but why, why, would he do this to his pip-plop-plop?@Ocarina
Finn@Oh, wait. You know, like, like maybe he's got a secret problem he can't tell us about, like with mob goons—like, like gambling debts or something.@Ocarina
Jake@Ooh, that's it! You're right! If we help him out of his secret jam, he won't need our money anymore. Look, there he goes now. Come on, let's follow him to the mob goons!@Ocarina
Finn@You sure this is right, Jake? I've never seen this place before. Looks like a fairy tale.@Ocarina
Jake@Yeah, man, the nose knows. I smelled him go in there ... and then I smelled him go up there .@Ocarina
Finn@Whoa. Kim Kil Whan is rich, like wow, like, hello, what? But if he doesn't need our money, what does he need? Throw pebbles at the glass to get his attention.@Ocarina
Jake@Hey, Son!@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Dad? What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?@Ocarina
Jake@Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. I never even looked for a job.@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Really?@Ocarina
Jake@I was thinkin' about you buying our tree house. I figured out that you don't need our money, so maybe you'd consider my counteroffer...@Ocarina
Jake@Father love! I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I lub you, I love you, I love you, I lub you. Come on, open it!@Ocarina
Jake@It's an ocarina. I made it for you.@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Oh.@Ocarina
Jake@Whenever you play it, you'll be reminded of your pep-pant's love.@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Thank, Dad.@Ocarina
Jake@Yeah, it's not hollow. I made the holes with the back end of a pencil.@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@I suppose I could accept the ocarina as legal trade. The tree house is yours, Dad.@Ocarina
Jake@Okay.@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Take care, Dad. I'll call.@Ocarina
Jake@I'll call!@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Okay, bye, Dad.@Ocarina
Jake@Later, Son!@Ocarina
Finn@Yeah!@Ocarina
Jake@Yeah, all right! Daddin'!@Ocarina
Pat@Sweetheart, how did it go?@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@Eh, all right, I guess. I don't know. He still lives the life of a child. I mean, it's his choice, but I really thought if he got a job and moved out of that tree house, it could have put some fire under him.@Ocarina
Pat@Aw, I'm sorry, Sweets.@Ocarina
Kim Kil Whan@No, I think I was wrong about Dad. I think he's good.@Ocarina

Ron James@A'ight, listen up, brahs. Here's the plan.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
All@Ooooh.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ron James@We're heading for Big Butt Rock. At sundown, we'll gather on the Cheek's Peak, and using the ah-has, deep feels, and woo-woos we score from the journey, we will chant a totally original spell, thus forming an entirely new school of magic! Kind of like those jerky secret societies, but less jerky.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Abracadaniel@Just got one more stop.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@Finn and Jake's crib? They won't come. They're out of our league.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Finn@Hey, Abracadaniel's here, with a bus full of lame wizards.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Jake@Here we go. They're probably gonna try to lure us on some dumb trip.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Abracadaniel@Hey, water nymphs! Uh...hi. Uh...do you girls feel like, uh...going on a road trip?@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Nymph@Um...no thanks.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!

Abracadaniel@I think we ran out of gas.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Little Dude@And the wheels fell off!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ron James@Well, this ain't goin' the way we planned, but fate has decreed that this place is just what we need. Draw your inspiration from this muddy, old cow pasture. Here, bros. We got a stock full of T.P. and magic ink.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Abracadaniel@Let's all write down arcane, cryptic words in unexpected new combinations and patterns. Maybe the nymphs can dance on top of the bus to be, like, our muses.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving@Inspire us, water nymphs!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Nymph@We don't want to. We'd rather write.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@I'll dance if dancing is needed. Doo-doo doo doo-doo. Yah yah, doo-doo wah Dance, dance, dancin' dance writing. I'm dance, dance, dance, dancin'. Top of the bus, window...@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Little Dude@Hey, check it out, y'all. The dirty old stranger's writing, too.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Farmer@What's all the ruckus?! I own this pasture, so get back in your vehicle and get!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@We can't! Our wheels fell off! Back on the vehicle. I'll make a slick ice road.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Farmer@Are you gone? I can't really see!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@Oh!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Abracadaniel@Is there a problem?@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@I ran out of juice.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Abracadaniel@Can I take over?@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@Yeah, maybe you should. Hey, let's switch headgear. Ooh, it fits! Yeah, girl, just let the ice magic flow. Oh, b-but be careful, okay?@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Abracadaniel@What?@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@Oh! Not me. Nice ice road.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Abracadaniel@Thanks. Hey, I don't think we're moving.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@Uh, hold on. Everyone, time to push the bus!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving@Eh, I don't really want to.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@Come on! Destiny! Okay, back on the bus! Back on the bus! Huh? Ooh, a crabapple tree. Giuseppe, make yourself useful and grab us some of them crabapples. Okay, get ready. Jump!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Little Dude@Oh, no! Giuseppe can't catch up!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@What?! Magus of Life Giving, take the wheel!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving@Uh, okay, but I am not a confident driver.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Little Dude@You're doing great, buddy.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving@Don't touch me!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@Giuseppe, throw the crabapples! Giuseppe? We have lost Giuseppe. Mm! Hmm? Well, let's see what old Giuseppe wrote. Listen to this, everybody! "These are not my tear drops, daughter dear, but just a sheen of dew that lingers here, past other fields where other fathers lie, who kept their daughters better far than I." What do you guys think? What's wrong with you guys?@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ron James@Look who's talking.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@Huh? This is true art. Well, let's see what you other guys wrote. Little Dude, here's yours. "Days don't have shades, directions with no ways, adjusting minimum scholarly curriculum to enrich empty minds, it takes refracted sunshines." That is awesome. "Take this light with your great might, free hearts that are gated seeing truth in things exaggerated." Ah, some interesting spell combos going on guys.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Abracadaniel@Ice King! I see the Butt Rock!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@The hour of glory is upon us. Cauldron!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Abracadaniel@Smells so good down here! What's cooking?@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Nymph@Girls, we can help. Okay, one, two, three! Lift! Ow! Ow. Um...let's get out of here.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@No, don't go. Hey, I could freeze all of us. Then we'd be safe from drowning, and once someone discovers our preserved bodies, we'll be saved! Be like, 200 years, tops!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving@Oh! Let me try this! Mommy!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Bus@Oh Grob, I can't swim! Aah! Oh Glob!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving@Ymmom! Somebody! Sorry.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ron James@I was hoping it wouldn't come to this. My "last resort" poshe, obtained from a mad yogi in the Mystery Mountains. It's time to find out what it does. Ba-bam! @Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Tree Trunks@Nice and slow. Ooh, gent--oh!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Tree Trunks@Oh, I'm flying!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@Yoink. Take my head away from here, baby! No!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Abracadaniel@Maybe this is a test from destiny, guys! If we all just surrender to these events, the answer will reveal itself. Whoa.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Little Dude@Wha? Hey, it's Giuseppe!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@Giuseppe, how have you done this?@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
All@Whoa.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Abracadaniel@What was he?@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@I don't know, Abracadaniel, but I think he was trying to show us something. Something new.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
2 Wizards@Sploo! Jicka haka boogy noona hubba gubba--secret wizard handshake!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Berdzerd@Later, Chinchizerd!@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Chinchizerd@Bye, Berdzerd. See you at the secret thing tonight! Loser.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Ice King@Giuseppe.@Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe!
Breakfast Princess@We are delighted to host this year's Princess Day in Breakfast Kingdom! Please enjoy the continental breakfast expertly prepared by our Breakfast Chefs. Now, on to more pressing matters. Brigands have been attacking our western seaports, dozens of unregistered princesses roam the land, and trade deficits are at an all-time high. Historically, Breakfast Kingdom has traded one sack of sugar a month to Slime Kingdom in exchange for four eggs, but egg production has plummeted!@Princess Day
Slime Princess@I can't just pop out eggs on command! I'm an artisan!@Princess Day
Breakfast Princess@You have an egg in you right now.@Princess Day
Slime Princess@How dare you?@Princess Day
Muscle Princess@Yeah, and what about that peanut juice, Peanut Princess? My body needs juice!@Princess Day
Peanut Princess@I'm not giving out a single drop of nut butter. Not until Raggedy Princess pays me!@Princess Day
Raggedy Princess@Fine! Take it! Take all my socks!@Princess Day
Peanut Princess@You still owe me a pair of jorts!@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@Aaah! You guys, I'm bored out of my face! I make a motion to stop talking about dumb stuff that's lame!@Princess Day
Breakfast Princess@Oh, Lumpy Space Princess, I'm afraid you'll have to be patient with us and our petty disputes. Not all of us have achieved the self-sufficiency that I assume you have in your kingdom. Oh wait, that's right. You don't have a kingdom! You live in a box in the woods.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@It's not a box. It's a rotting log.@Princess Day
Breakfast Princess@Sorry, LSP, but the chair only recognizes real princesses, not bums.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@What?! I'm like a cool hippie!@Princess Day
Breakfast Princess@Whatever, freeloader. If you were invited to Princess Day, it must have been a mistake or as a joke. Am I right, girls?@Princess Day
Strudel Princess@Ohh!@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@The joke's on you because I wasn't invited. I'm crashing! And I already ate a bunch of your food! What you gonna do about it, Princess Egg Breath?@Princess Day
All@Ooh!@Princess Day
Cinnamon Bun@That's true. She does have egg breath.@Princess Day
Breakfast Princess@Okay, you've wasted enough of our time. Guards, take this pamplemousse out of my sight.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@You didn't! Don't touch me!@Princess Day
Marceline@Hmm.@Princess Day
Breakfast Princess@Okay. Now that the wannabe's gone, let's get back to princess business. O-Oh, n-not you, Princess Business. Uh, princess business. No, sounds the same. I'm sorry.@Princess Day
Marceline@Hey, you want to ditch this jazz?@Princess Day
Princess Bubblegum@I'd love to, but I'm really invested in this crossword puzzle.@Princess Day
Marceline@Figs.@Princess Day
Princess Bubblegum@Hmm.@Princess Day
Marceline@LSP, wait up! Whoa.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@Lousy Breakfast Princess. Pamplemousse. What is that even?@Princess Day
Marceline@Yo, LSP. Sick tag.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh. Thanks?@Princess Day
Marceline@You know, I like your vibe, dude. You don't take anyone's sass.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@Yeah, especially not from that gross pile of greasy hash! She lumpin' humiliated me!@Princess Day
Marceline@Listen, let's get even. Teach Old Greasy Locks a lesson.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@You're bad. And I like it!@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@This place is huge!@Princess Day
Marceline@This place smells like butter, bacon, sausage, and juice.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@Gonna mess with Breakfast Princess, 'cause she called me pamplemousse.@Princess Day
Marceline@"Yobo, Peebocheeks. Just kicking down the town with LSP-boos. She is acting sooo bad."@Princess Day
Princess Bubblegum@"Ha. Just don't let her get out of control."@Princess Day
Marceline@"Too late. LSP is really doing it up right now. And I'm just feeding the flames."@Princess Day
Princess Bubblegum@"Nooooo" exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation point!@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@Look. There. Breakfast Princess' room.@Princess Day
Marceline@How do you want to get past the Maple Man?@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@I'll show you, hon. Ooh! Aah! Hey there! Yeah, look over here!@Princess Day
Syrup Guard@What?@Princess Day
Marceline@Nice distraction.@Princess Day
Both@Right on.@Princess Day
Marceline@Ugh. I can't digest syrup.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@That's for poisoning my girl.@Princess Day
Marceline@Stop! Okay, just one more time.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@I thought you were bad. Bad people don't stop.@Princess Day
Marceline@Let's don't stop inside.@Princess Day
Both@P-p-p-payback!@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@Ugh. All her clothes are sticky.@Princess Day
Marceline@And her taste in music is terrible. Check it out. I hate this album, but I'm taking it anyway.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@That's messed up! This'll teach Breakfast Princess.@Princess Day
Syrup Guard #2@Huh? Jerry! Who did this to you, Jerry?@Princess Day
Jerry@I don't know, but they got past me.@Princess Day
Marceline@We're busted. Turn invisible!@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@I can't.@Princess Day
Marceline@Well, hide then.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@Uh..Hide where?@Princess Day
Syrup Guard #2@I know somebody's in here. I-I heard someone say "where." Getting close now! No sign of the intrud..er. Aah! My eyes! Oh, smells like grapefruit.@Princess Day
Both@Yeah!@Princess Day
Syrup Guard #2@When I recover my sight, I'm going to imprison you, you giggling girls! Aah!@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@I got this.@Princess Day
Syrup Guard #2@I don't see them.@Princess Day
Both@Hey.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, glob.@Princess Day
Both@He's okay!@Princess Day
Syrup Guard #3@Other Jerry, what happened?@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess & Marceline@Yeah!@Princess Day
Breakfast Princess@Okay, let's take a lunch break, everybody. Oh, when I mean lunch, I, of course, mean breakfast.@Princess Day
Syrup Guard #4@Your highness. There are vandals ruining the castle. They are bad.@Princess Day
Breakfast Princess@Okay, I'll handle it. Fellow princesses, I got to deal with matters of state. My little sister, Strudel Princess, will take over for me.@Princess Day
Strudel Princess@Eat the berries, dip them in the syrup, whoop whoop, want me to show you how?@Princess Day
Both@Whoo!@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@A squirrel taught me how to do that.@Princess Day
Marceline@That's awesome.@Princess Day
Breakfast Princess@Stop right there!@Princess Day
Marceline@Hey! Calm your lumps. It's okay! She's just dazed. I'll handle it. Come on. It'll be okay, dude. Girls like us just got to stick together.@Princess Day
Breakfast Princess@LSP, is that you?@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@Oh, glob, no. Not even.@Princess Day
Breakfast Princess@What's this for?@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@For digging. Now start building a sand castle. Don't stop digging or we'll know!@Princess Day
Both@Whoo!@Princess Day
Marceline@Yeah.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@That was totally fun being bad with you, Marcy.@Princess Day
Marceline@Yeah, that was pretty rad.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@Do you think, like, doing all that bad stuff makes us...like, bad people?@Princess Day
Marceline@Uh...probably not. I don't think there are bad people. I think good people do bad stuff sometimes, and, oh, that's bad. But only if you do it once, it's just a mistake, and...that's not bad. I think.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@Word.@Princess Day
Marceline@But...I mean, I do think it was wrong to steal this CD.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@Yeah, I feel kind of bad about that.@Princess Day
Marceline@We should probably mail it back to her.@Princess Day
Lumpy Space Princess@Yeah. Good call. I—Oh my glob!@Princess Day
Both@Pow!@Princess Day
Strudel Princess@-Couldn't get up from the bed. I was lazy, and that's why I can't have frosting anymore. Okay, so does everybody have what they want?@Princess Day
Slime Princess@Wait, I think I'm ready to pop it.@Princess Day
Strudel Princess@Happy Princess Day!@Princess Day
Kenneth@Uhh, hello? Hi. Uh, is this the secret mee—@Nemesis
Candy Person@What errand? What haste?@Nemesis
Kenneth@Uh. Oh, shoot. Oh! "To beelzebub with the brewer's knave!" @Nemesis
Starchie@Ahh, Kenneth.@Nemesis
Kenneth@Hey, Starchie.@Nemesis
Starchie@Glad you could make it. I officially call this meeting of the veritas brigade to order. Lux in tenebris.@Nemesis
Kenneth, Banana Guard, Nurse Pound Cake & Science@Lux in tenebris.@Nemesis
Starchie@So, anybody have weird stuff to report?@Nemesis
Nurse Pound Cake@Well, sometimes at night, I see a shadowy figure around Princess Bubblegum's tower. I have a feeling it might be otherworldly!@Nemesis
Starchie@Whoa, this is some good stuff. We are this close to finally exposing the princess' shady dealings. Meanwhile, PB remains blissfully unaware up in her ivory tower.@Nemesis
Kenneth@Excuse me. I believe I've made a startling discovery of my own. I've developed this high-tech device. It broadcasts waves that—theoretically—disrupt parallel dimensions!@Nemesis
Starchie@Whoa, Kenny boy, you're blowing my mind.@Nemesis
Peace Master@So...a tinkerer, eh? Fiddling at the fringes of unknown realms. Tell me, Kenneth, will you be ready when the flames of those evil places consume everything you hold dear?! I thought not!@Nemesis
Starchie@Hey, Peace Master. Ohh! Oh! My noodle.@Nemesis
Peace Master@There is something very wrong dwelling in the Candy Kingdom...a dark entity I plan to purge from the face of Ooo.@Nemesis
Princess Bubblegum@Oh! Uh oh!@Nemesis
Peace Master@Its presence has infected every home, every place of business, even here in this very room. Yes, this foul creature watches us even.. Now! I know you can hear me. Tonight your reign ends. 'Cause I am totally gonna vanquish you!@Nemesis
Princess Bubblegum@Whoa! Holy flippin' flap! Red alert! Pep But, start brewing up some chamomile tea so I don't stress out!@Nemesis
Peace Master@Sorry, I hate evil so much.@Nemesis
Starchie@It's all cool, Peace Master. Truth sleuths keep it real.@Nemesis
Peace Master@Yes. As lone scouts, we may fall, but together we will stand as a mighty force! Oh, dang. I gotta go. But I shall return in one hour!@Nemesis
Starchie@Alright, Peace Master. We'll be ready. Mm. Dill-icious!@Nemesis
Peace Master@Dun-de-dun-dun-dun, Peace Master! Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.@Nemesis
Peace Master's Daughter@Finally.@Nemesis
Peace Master@Uh, sorry about the wait, guys. Daddy was pontificating.@Nemesis
Peace Master's Daughter@Hey, Dad, can we go to the Sorcery and Dark Arts fair tomorrow?@Nemesis
Peace Master@No, honey, that stuff is highly inappropriate for kids. Daddy works very hard to protect you guys from that kind of stuff. If you only knew of the monstrosities that lurk around every corner.@Nemesis
Peace Master's Son@Dark Arts!@Nemesis
Peace Master@Stop laughing! You're stressing daddy out! See?! See what happens when you mess with the dark arts? I'll get you, dark one! You wrecked Peace Master's minivan!@Nemesis
Princess Bubblegum@Yo! Red alert! Right, guys? What'cha doin' about it?!@Nemesis
Colonel Candy Corn@Whoa, be careful about old man naptime, please. That could have been it for me just now.@Nemesis
Princess Bubblegum@What is going on here?@Nemesis
Banana Guard@Don't. No! Hey, watch your pieces, man.@Nemesis
Princess Bubblegum@I thought you were gonna whip these guys into shape, Colonel.@Nemesis
Colonel Candy Corn@PB, you can't teach a butterfly to bark. You know what I'm saying? Well, they like my stories. They're good listeners. It ain't like them old days with those hard-nosed Rattleball boys. Say, what happened to them Rattleball boys?@Nemesis
Princess Bubblegum@Okay, you guys. Keep up the good work.@Nemesis
Finn@What was your count?@Nemesis
Jake@Uh, 3 minutes. What about you?@Nemesis
Finn@Uh, 3 minutes, 30 seconds.@Nemesis
Jake@What's that? Your invisible watch?@Nemesis
Finn@No, I was just pointing at my wrist.@Nemesis
Rattleballs@57 seconds.@Nemesis
Jake@Oh, dang, we were both counting fast.@Nemesis
Finn@Hey, Rattleballs, are you sure you're waterproof?@Nemesis
Rattleballs@No.@Nemesis
Jake@Do you even need to breathe, Rattleballs?@Nemesis
Rattleballs@Continue training. 3, 2, 1...@Nemesis
Princess Bubblegum@Hey, Peps, where's the tea?!@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@Uh, just a second.@Nemesis
Princess Bubblegum@Just leave it out for me. I'm gonna go find Finn or Rattleballs or somebody to run down this Peace Master bozo. "Take my time"? Alright.@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@Ooh-wah, oooh-wah. My light will move in darkness. I go unseen by low level biddies. Whah-ha! Yes! Light of the hermit, reveal my nemesis, and in the folds of Horus, carry me in haste! Fold, I say! Yaaaah!@Nemesis
Peace Master@You going stinkhouse, baby? Ooh. Whomp! Almost got me, but my lucky talisman sensed your presence.@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@Haha!@Nemesis
Peace Master@Look here, friends. The beast lies exposed!@Nemesis
Starchie@Oh, this is a mistake. That's my boy, Peppermint Butler.@Nemesis
Peace Master@His powers of darkness made me go crazy and crash my minivan earlier!@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@You need to chill, Peace Master. I'm just a harmless, old butler.@Nemesis
Peace Master@Mm? Ha ha! In you go! You see this?! My dark wizard gobbler poots evil souls into the void.@Nemesis
Starchie@You can't do that to our friend!@Nemesis
Peace Master@Oh. I see how it is. Maybe y'all should get in here, too. Digest! @Nemesis
Kenneth@Dimension disruptor, come on! Please, please, please, please! Yes!@Nemesis
Peace Master@Impossible!@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@Time-out.@Nemesis
Peace Master@You can't time-ou—@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@Whazaa! Whoop!@Nemesis
Peace Master@No! Your dirty hobo birthday tricks won't save you long time! You hear?! You still here?@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@Uh, no? I-I don't know. No.@Nemesis
Peace Master@Then hear my challenge! On the field of wizard battles, armed in my talismans of light, I will destroy you and free my children from the spell you cast over their minds!@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@I accept!@Nemesis
Peace Master@See you tomorrow, butler.@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@See you tomorrow, momo.@Nemesis
Peace Master@Tomorrow! Peppermint Burfer, show yourself!@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@Yeah, yeah, I'm here...momo.@Nemesis
Peace Master@You're the momo. Your spells are no match for my righteous charm sack.@Nemesis
Peace Master's Son@Dark arts!@Nemesis
Peace Master@My kids!@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@You like hunting monsters, do you? Lords of the Nightosphere, he must pay a penalty. Transfigure this babe into a super-weirdie!@Nemesis
Peace Master's Son@Ha!@Nemesis
Peace Master@Noooo!@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@Bam! Now you got a monster kid.@Nemesis
Peace Master@Son!@Nemesis
Peace Master's Son@Look, Pappy! Dark magic!@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@Remember, you still got two non-monster kids. And if you want to keep them that way, you better toss all your charms down the hole!@Nemesis
Peace Master@I will smite thee.@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@A'ight.@Nemesis
Peace Master's Daughter@Whoa, sweet!@Nemesis
Peace Master@Nooo! Alright, alright. Okay, you win.@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@One more thing. Show us your underwear.@Nemesis
Peace Master@You fiend.@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@Now, um, uh, walk around like a big chicken.@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@Now eat some dirt off the ground.@Nemesis
Peace Master@Please don't make me.@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@'Ey! You want three demon babies?!@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@Okay, stop. I took it too far. We're done here. R-Run along, children.@Nemesis
Peace Master's Son@Dada, can I go to the park and eat flies?@Nemesis
Peace Master@Yes?@Nemesis
Colonel Candy Corn@Princess, I think I got something on camera 206! Just look at that sicko.@Nemesis
Princess Bubblegum@Where's Peace Master?! Gah, I am freaking out here!@Nemesis
Peppermint Butler@Princess, your chamomile tea.@Nemesis
Princess Bubblegum@Whff! Thanks.@Nemesis
Colonel Candy Corn@Well, how do I check my e-mails on this?@Nemesis
Finn & BMO@Birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday , birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday! Yeah! Yay!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Finn@Nice job, Mr. Birthday Boy.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Jake@Thanks.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Finn@Man, you are like another year older, but you look good. Like, super good.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Jake@Yup. Mom and dad passed down some pretty good genes.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Finn@Oh yeah, mom and dad. Hey, did mom and dad tell you any stories about when you were born?@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
BMO@Yay! Birthday story time, please.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Jake@Well, it was a day like any other day...@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@There, there, baby. You're going to be a fighter. Just like your mother. Yes! Barrel roll. Ugh!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Steak break.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Let's get started.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@These steaks are tough and stringy. Like you.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Oh, good one, dear. Hey, after dinner, what do you say we check the ticker-type for new cases?@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Margaret, you're in a family way now. You should take a backseat from investigations.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Oh, come on, Joshua. Even with this ankle-biter, I'm as quick as ever. Sure, my waist is bigger, but that just means more bullets in my ammo belt.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@You're missing the point, sugar. What if something bad happens? Let's say we're out on the beat, fighting some lowlife. He takes a punch, you zig when you should've zagged, and oops! Junior takes a knock to the noodle, comes out with the shiner the size of a grapefruit. I can't take that kind of guilt and neither can you.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@I can take care of myself just fine. And besides, these babies don't come cheap. We need to work together as a team to bring in the bread.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Yeah, you got me there.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Now let's get over to that ticker-type and look for some perps.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@You relax, dear, I got it. Hmm. Let's get a look here. "Vampire girl spotted in the Grass Lands harassing sheep and cattle." Nope, nope, nope. "Small fire goblin burns down Candy Kingdom forest."@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Hey, that sounds fun. Let's do that.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Wait, wait, here's one. " Woman's pies go missing in Bucolic Countryside where nothing ever happens." The perfect case for my pregnant wife!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@What?@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Now let's get an egg in our shoe and beat it.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Tree Trunks@Yes? Hello?@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Afternoon, Mrs. Tree Trunks. We're Joshua and Margaret of Joshua and Margaret Investigations. And this is our boy. We're responding to a wire about missing pies.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Tree Trunks@Oh, yes. A-a-a monster's been stealing my pies off of the windowsill.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@A monster, eh?@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Tree Trunks@Oh, yes, you can see the monster tracks leading off into the forest.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Well, those tracks are as phony as a three dollar bill.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Tree Trunks@The monster tracks are very real. My husband told me so. Wyatt!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Wyatt@Aw, aw geez. You got me.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@What's the big idea, Wyatt? Why'd you burgle your wife's pie?@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Wyatt@Because it's amazing! Oh, I can't get enough of it.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Tree Trunks@You could just ask for seconds.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Wyatt@But I want thirds and fourths! I want to stop when I want to stop!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Tree Trunks@Oh, Wyatt.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Wyatt@Oh, it's the only good part of my day.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Well, there you have it. The only monster here was this man's appetite for his wife's pie.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Tree Trunks@Oh, no. But the monster is real. He snuck up and rubbed my elbow while I was gardening. And Leftenant Candy Corn said it came in through the window and touched him on the chest. Oh! Oh, now I got myself all scared. W-won't you check around to make sure no one is out there?@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Of course. Probably nothing more than a peeper. Ha! These country yokels are all just superstitious. I bet you that old elephant sees a monster a day.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Joshua, look! Something way larger than Wyatt made them. These tracks look real.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Hot cram! A peeping monster! Oh, this town would surely put up a collection to nab this guy. Oh, too bad you're preggo. We got to pass.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Come on, Joshua!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@What?@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Ha ha!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Margaret! Margaret! Wait for Pappy!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Hmm. The tracks end here.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Hey, hey! Beat it, uggos! The peeper!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@I'll show that peepsie the pepper! Joshua, dear, I'm stuck! Joshua! The beast outflanked us!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Gads! Boom! Do your worst, you masher.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Joshua! Drop that daddy! Baby cakes! Oh, this is all my fault!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Uh, yeah, pretty much.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Ah, good last meal. Okay, well, I got bit by a monster, a creature of the night. We both know what comes next for me. Just make it snappy, darling.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Don't. Don't be melodramatic, Joshua. I've been doing some research. Listen here. I think if we can get a sample of that creature's venom, we can use it to synthesize an antidote. Joshua?! Oh! Puddin' Pie!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@I'm fine. Just got to pop out and fetch that venom.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@You're about as fine as a canary in a cat mine! Oof! Hey, where's the fire, kiddo? You stay put. So's I can keep tabs on you. Feel better. Over. @Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Come in, Margaret. Do you read me? Over.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@I got the peep peep's trail. In pursuit.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@You have to say "over" or I think you're still talking. Over.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Joshua, I've stumbled upon the beast's lair. Just hang on, Honey Bunny. Over. Stay right there. What?! Ooh! Not yet! Come on, come on! What? What's your angle, slick? You poison my hubby, then play the innocent? And what's with all this baby paraphernalia? Wait a tick. Are you a baby?@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Monster@Uh-huh.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Oh, no! I must've scared the dickens out of you! There, there, baby. I'm so sorry... For this! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Joshua, I got the venom! Ohhh! Uh oh, this baby business is getting SERIOUS! Joshua! Ohhh! Ohhh! @Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Margaret, stay away. Something's about to happen!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Something's about to happen with me too!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Margaret! Shine the light, dear. Yowzers!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Puppy Jake@Hello, daddy. Hello, mommy. It's so nice to be here with you now.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Boy, Jake left a scar on my head the size of a nickel. I'll have to wear a hat now, Margaret.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Well, I think you'll look good in one. Are you sure having him next to Jermaine is safe? We don't even know what he is.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Of course we do, dear. He's our boy.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@That he is.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Joshua@Yes, we've got one boy that I gave birth to and one boy that you gave birth to. Let's never tell him how it happened.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Margaret@Agreed.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Jake@And so they never told me.@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Finn@Never told you what?@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
Jake@I don't know. They never told me. Ha!@Joshua & Margaret Investigations
BMO@Kya! Kya! Hmm.@Ghost Fly
BMO@Ohhh, that's pretty good. Kya!@Ghost Fly
Jake@BMO... keep it down!@Ghost Fly
BMO@But you said 800 to 1000 is my time to do karate. It's my karate time!@Ghost Fly
Jake@I know, but I got a headache, and I'm in a funky mood.@Ghost Fly
Finn@What's wrong, dude?@Ghost Fly
Jake@I don't know. I think I got restless leg syndrome.@Ghost Fly
Finn@Is that from getting chubby?@Ghost Fly
Jake@What? No, man, it's just restless leg.@Ghost Fly
Finn@Oop! My bad.@Ghost Fly
Jake@What are you reading?@Ghost Fly
Finn@This old copy of Adventure Boy magazine—the only magazine for boy adventurers. This kid Rusty is getting chased down the river by three grown otters. This magazine rules! But I'm saving the end for tomorrow.@Ghost Fly
Jake@Cool.@Ghost Fly
Finn@Well, I hope your leg feels better. I'm turning in. I'll see you up there.@Ghost Fly
BMO@Jake...@Ghost Fly
Jake@No, BMO.@Ghost Fly
BMO@KYA!@Ghost Fly
Jake@No, BMO! No more! Maybe some soup will take the edge off.@Ghost Fly
Jake@Ew! Gross! Nasty! Hyah!@Ghost Fly
Jake@I'm sorry you were born a fly and I had to kill you, you disgusting, disgusting creature.@Ghost Fly
BMO@Kya! Kya! Kya!@Ghost Fly
Jake@BMO, PLEASE!@Ghost Fly
Jake@Finn, was that you?@Ghost Fly
Jake@Probably just BMO or something.@Ghost Fly
Jake@That's weird. BMO doesn't like 30's jazz. Yeesh. Creepy.@Ghost Fly
Jake@I didn't know we had one of those.@Ghost Fly
Voice@Oooooo...@Ghost Fly
Jake@Hey, hey. Hey, who?@Ghost Fly
Jake@Aah!@Ghost Fly
Ghost Fly@Ooooooo...@Ghost Fly
Jake@Hey! I killed you!@Ghost Fly
Jake@Aah! Aah! Ghost fly touching me! Finn! Finn!@Ghost Fly
Finn@Aah!@Ghost Fly
Jake@Ghost fly, man! Aah! Aah!@Ghost Fly
Finn@Okay.@Ghost Fly
Jake@Come on, man. Let's get out of the house. It's a ghost fly!@Ghost Fly
Finn@So what?@Ghost Fly
Jake@No, man, ghost flies are filthy! They carry diseases, such as tuberculosis, polio, dysentery. They leave those little fly doodies on your soul.@Ghost Fly
Jake@Aah!@Ghost Fly
BMO@Finn, Jake! What's wrong?!@Ghost Fly
Finn & Jake@Ghost fly!@Ghost Fly
Jake@Thank goodness we lost him. He's gone.@Ghost Fly
Ghost Fly@Whoo.@Ghost Fly
BMO@Run! Just run!@Ghost Fly
Finn@Ay-ay-ay-ay!@Ghost Fly
BMO@Hmm. Kya! Kya!@Ghost Fly
Jake@We should ask what its unfinished business is. Ghosts always have unfinished business.@Ghost Fly
Finn@Ghost fly, what's your problem?!@Ghost Fly
Finn@Come on, dude. Tell us your unfinished business!@Ghost Fly
Finn@Aah! It's no good. He's a tortured little spirit. We need help to communicate with this ghost fly.@Ghost Fly
Jake@Nah, man, let's just get someone to banish it—someone with serious paranormal juice.@Ghost Fly
BMO@Is he coming soon?@Ghost Fly
Jake@I think so. His ways are kind of mysterious.@Ghost Fly
Finn@That's cool.@Ghost Fly
Ghost Fly@Woo?@Ghost Fly
Peppermint Butler@Let's get this ritual rolling. I got stuff to do.@Ghost Fly
Ghost Fly@Woo!@Ghost Fly
Peppermint Butler@Hey! No! Unclean demon, feel the sting of holy water!@Ghost Fly
Jake@Thank you.@Ghost Fly
Peppermint Butler@These circles will protect you from the ghost's attacks while I prepare the banishing ritual. Worry not, fellow believers, for in this bag, I possess all the darkest and most powerful tools of magic ever to be assembled in one place. We're perfectly safe—as long as... we... have...@Ghost Fly
Jake@Well, huh. How about that? No biggie. We'll just hang out inside these magic circles until morning. That's when ghosts go to sleep. Yep. Just got to make it... till morning.@Ghost Fly
Ghost Fly@Woo!@Ghost Fly
Finn@Hmm?@Ghost Fly
Finn@The end of my story. And it's so close.@Ghost Fly
Jake@Don't do it, bro. It's a trap.@Ghost Fly
Finn@I know. It's an obvi trap. But wait. What if... watch this. Ha! Mm?@Ghost Fly
Jake@Dude, what are you—?@Ghost Fly
Finn@If I extend the circle... farther... I can get closer to the magazine.@Ghost Fly
BMO@Theoretically, that is possible.@Ghost Fly
Jake@Yeah, but I'm still getting a "woo-jah" feeling. This seems like a bad idea.@Ghost Fly
Finn@Just have to stay inside this circle.@Ghost Fly
Finn@Ha ha! How'd you do it, Rusty? How'd you shake them otters? Man, what a great ending!@Ghost Fly
Jake@Finn? What's wrong, buddy?@Ghost Fly
Jake@Oh, Finn, you're disgusting!@Ghost Fly
Jake@Aw, that's it! I've had it with this ghost fly! I wish I were a ghost so I could punch him with my ghost fist!@Ghost Fly
BMO@Jake, I have a radical option. I've been studying a karate move that could temporarily stop your heart long enough for you to fight the ghost on his own plane of existence.@Ghost Fly
Jake@What?@Ghost Fly
BMO@It's okay! I learned it out of a magazine.@Ghost Fly
Jake@Finn... All right. But first you got to give me some unfinished business so I can come back as a ghost.@Ghost Fly
BMO@Tell me a joke.@Ghost Fly
Jake@Okay. What do you call a bear that only attacks guys named Paul?@Ghost Fly
BMO@Kya!@Ghost Fly
BMO@I killed Jake! Yay, BMO!@Ghost Fly
Ghost Jake@Whoa! BMO, you killed me. Whoa. Wow. Wow!@Ghost Fly
BMO@Jake! I can't hear you! I will start your heart up in five minutes, okay? This many!@Ghost Fly
Jake@Okay. Five minutes. Whoa.@Ghost Fly
Jake@Is this some kind of low-level dead world? That's a bummer.@Ghost Fly
Jake@Aah!@Ghost Fly
Jake@Aah! Oh, stuff! Aah!@Ghost Fly
Jake@Ohh! Ohh! Get away!@Ghost Fly
Jake@Aah! You killed it! Aah!@Ghost Fly
Jake@Aah! Aah! Get away!@Ghost Fly
Ghost Soup@Oooooo...@Ghost Fly
Ghost Fly@Hmm?@Ghost Fly
Ghost Soup@Hoooooo!@Ghost Fly
Jake@That's right. You never finished the soup. That's your unfinished business!@Ghost Fly
Ghost Fly@Woo-woo.@Ghost Fly
Jake@And now that you've finished it, you get to ascend to a glorious, new peaceful realm.@Ghost Fly
Jake@Ahhh. Bam! Shouldn't have tried to kill me, son! Yes! What's happening? Oh, BMO must be bringing me back! Yes! Yeah, BMO!@Ghost Fly
Jake@Mm. BMO?@Ghost Fly
Finn@Jake, I missed you, bro!@Ghost Fly
BMO@Jake!@Ghost Fly
Finn@Don't ever leave me again!@Ghost Fly
Jake@Good job, BMO! You brought me back.@Ghost Fly
BMO@Yes. Yay, BMO. BMO is so good.@Ghost Fly
Doctor Princess@Whew!@Ghost Fly

Goose@"I've never been here." You've still got it, Jake.@Everything's Jake
Goose@C'mon! Let's get you home. Everyone's waiting for you at the party.@Everything's Jake

Goose@Cheeseburger cheesecake ring a bell?@Everything's Jake
Jake@What—? What is that?@Everything's Jake
Goose@Oh, oh, that. Don't worry about that. Do not—don't worry about that.@Everything's Jake
Jake@Guess I'd better not worry about it. Hmm. I'm hungies, Goose.@Everything's Jake
Goose@I think there's a leftover nacho basket or something in the fridge.@Everything's Jake
Goose@Just a sec. Cold cut-and-nacho sandwiches!@Everything's Jake

Urchin@Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake, the Mayor wants to see you straightaway.@Everything's Jake

Urchin@Right-o!@Everything's Jake
Mayor@Hello, Jake. Thanks for making it.@Everything's Jake
Jake@Heh. Okay.@Everything's Jake
Mayor@Now look, we're at orange alert here. Below us are gathered the city's top minds.@Everything's Jake
Jake@Hmm.@Everything's Jake
Mayor@And they've noticed that our seismographic troubles have increased exponentially since your arrival.@Everything's Jake
Jake@Mayor, uh, I want to meet these minds.@Everything's Jake
Mayor@Here are some of the minds.@Everything's Jake
Scientist@Jake, we want to perform some tests on you to discover the cause of the quakes.@Everything's Jake
Jake@There's no need. I've got it figured out. The tremors are happening because Jake is hungry, and his stomach is growling. And the hungrier he gets, the worse the quakes will become.@Everything's Jake
Jake@I'll prove it!@Everything's Jake
Scientists@Huh?@Everything's Jake
Jake@Mention a food item.@Everything's Jake
Scientist@Omelet.@Everything's Jake
Jake@What's in the omelet?@Everything's Jake
Scientist@Chili! It's a four-egg chili omelet!@Everything's Jake
Scientist@Watch out!@Everything's Jake
Scientist@Analysis, Tim!@Everything's Jake
Tim@It's too early to say; this evidence is anecdotal!@Everything's Jake
Jake@Look, just let me stretch outside to get something to eat, and the quakes will stop.@Everything's Jake
Tim@That doesn't sound very science-y.@Everything's Jake
Scientist@No, but you have my permission to test your idea.@Everything's Jake
Dr. Erik Adamkinson@I don't like that idea.@Everything's Jake
Scientists@Huh?@Everything's Jake
Dr. Erik Adamkinson@If Jake leaves, that would mean the utter destruction of our world. I believe that Jake is an extra-dimensional being, a Glob if you will, whose psychic field holds our world together. If he leaves, his flesh will reconfigure, and everything and everyone here will disappear completely!@Everything's Jake
Tim@Oh, Dr. Erik Adamkinson, you're just a fringe scientist, well known to have a crackpot of crazy theories.@Everything's Jake
Dr. Erik Adamkinson@Hm! Perhaps I am. And maybe I am wrong... but are you really willing to take that chance? We should imprison Jake immediately!@Everything's Jake
Jake@What?! No way! The world's not gonna end just because I go get a bagel.@Everything's Jake
Mayor@Seize him!@Everything's Jake
Jake@Uh, peace!@Everything's Jake
Jake@Why?!@Everything's Jake
Mayor@Finish him.@Everything's Jake
Jake@Mm. Bagel.@Everything's Jake
Dr. Erik Adamkinson@Don't worry, everybody. I will journey to Jake's Glob world, which, legend would have us believe, lies beyond the great sky-hole, and bring back the food of the globs to appease Jake's appetite, thus saving everybody.@Everything's Jake
Dr. Erik Adamkinson's father@Wait! Wait! I want to go with you, Son!@Everything's Jake
Dr. Erik Adamkinson@I-I'm sorry, Dad. Y-you can't; i-it's too dangerous. Your mind is unprepared.@Everything's Jake
Dr. Erik Adamkinson's father@My son.@Everything's Jake
Dr. Erik Adamkinson@Huh? Yeah!@Everything's Jake
Dr. Erik Adamkinson@There it is, the sky ho-o-o-o-ole!@Everything's Jake
Dr. Erik Adamkinson@Phew! Oh, my stars! It's just as I envisioned! Almighty Jake Globs, I beseech your aid! Do you have bagels? Hello? Hmm. Maybe those aren't the true globs. Yeah, they're too ugly to be—@Everything's Jake
Dr. Erik Adamkinson@I thought you'd be beautiful. But you're not! You're hideous! Hideous!@Everything's Jake

Jake@But—@Everything's Jake

The Lich@Wake up.@Is That You?
Prismo@Wa—Wait, I've changed my mind—@Is That You?
Jake@Wait, why is this happening? It's like a rerun of the worst junk.@Is That You?
Jake@Lich life-sucks Prismo's dream host, eliminates Prismo forever. Ugh, it's mad gris bro. And then the Space Police, or whatever they're called, show up because boppin' Prismo is a cosmic crime. I remember feelin' like someone had peeled a layer away from my brain, and my reality was no longer anchored to any point of reference, and I had to fight to keep from being crushed under the weight of an unforgiving new paradigm of ultimate reality. So cool, man. So why am I seeing this again?@Is That You?
Jake@Uhhh, that's cool...@Is That You?
Jake@Uhh, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool? Tough guy contest! Whoo-hoo! Tough boys!@Is That You?
Jake@Come on, man! Tough Guy contest me!@Is That You?
Finn@Okay, seems like all of Jake's remanifesting themselves, but as soon as I break their history it creates a paradox and Jake explodes.@Is That You?

Finn@All this striz happened when Jake and I tried to preserve Prismo's pickles in our dreams, something must have changed when we went to sleep!@Is That You?

Prismo@Yep, I'm still dead. I'm actually talking to you from the past, I set up this plan B scenario in case I ever got croaked for reals. So if this is happening then I guess I got croaked and my pickles ran out. But Jake and I established a bro-bond that could bring me back through his dreams.@Is That You?

Finn@This is me? This sword is me?@Is That You?
Prismo@Finn sword, dude.@Is That You?
Finn@Welcome back, Prismo.@Is That You?
Prismo@Thank you, Finn.@Is That You?
Jake@Welcome back, Prismo.@Is That You?
Prismo@Thank you, Jake.@Is That You?
Finn@Hey, man.@Jake the Brick
Jake@Oh, hey, Finn! So you got my map?@Jake the Brick
Finn@Yeah.@Jake the Brick
Finn@So... how's your experiment going?@Jake the Brick
Jake@Ah, it's goin' great. I really feel like I fit in, so to speak.@Jake the Brick
Finn@So... are you ready to come home?@Jake the Brick
Jake@Nah, I think I was just gonna keep being a brick for a while.@Jake the Brick
Finn@Umm... what are you doing again?@Jake the Brick
Jake@Finn, ever since I was little, I wanted to see what it's like to be a brick in a brick shack when the brick shack falls down. And this shack is gonna fall down. Just look at it. Like sandcastles in the sun, baby. You're too young; you wouldn't understand.@Jake the Brick
Finn@You're right. I don't understand. But I'm cool with your mystical journey or whatever. I'm gonna leave this walkie-talkie so we can stay in touch. Just in case.@Jake the Brick
Jake@What? No, man, bricks don't stay in touch!@Jake the Brick
Finn@Dude, BMO is, like, really worried about you.@Jake the Brick
Jake@Aww. You tell that little goofball I said hi.@Jake the Brick
Finn@I will. Well, I guess I should head back.@Jake the Brick
Jake@Oh. Really? So soon?@Jake the Brick
Finn@Yeah, well, it took me, like, half a day to get here. Besides, you're just a brick, right?@Jake the Brick
Jake@Yeah.@Jake the Brick
Finn@Alright, see ya, Jake!@Jake the Brick
Jake@Bye! Okay, back to being a brick. I'm so bored.@Jake the Brick
Jake@Ooh, I'm starting to get a little tippy in my teacups.@Jake the Brick
Jake@A bunny!@Jake the Brick
Jake@Looks like our long-eared friend is on to something. Bunnies love to dig. He's making a supreme effort, and I think I can guess why.@Jake the Brick
Jake@That's right. A carrot, grown out here free and wild, probably the result of a seed pooped out by a passing bird.@Jake the Brick
Jake@But what's this? A mysterious rustling in the bush. Could mean trouble. Mr. Bunny seems to think so. His sensitive whiskers quiver at the hint of imminent danger.@Jake the Brick
Jake@Unfortunately for Mr. Bunny, this is what nature is all about. It's a male deer. Not a threat to Mr. Bunny in the predatory sense, but still above him in the food chain. Mr. Bunny, wishing to avoid an encounter, hops away to safety.@Jake the Brick
Jake@Wow, deers are jerks.@Jake the Brick
Finn@Hey, man. You know I can hear everything you say, right?@Jake the Brick
Jake@What?! Arrrrrgh! No! I had no idea.@Jake the Brick
Finn@Yeah, but you saw me leave the walkie-talkie, and I left it on. You know that, right?@Jake the Brick
BMO@Hi, Jake!@Jake the Brick
Jake@Hi, BMO.@Jake the Brick
Finn@Need anything? A soda?@Jake the Brick
Jake@No.@Jake the Brick
Finn@So what's Mr. Bunny doing now?@Jake the Brick
Jake@It's not about the bunny! The bunny is incidental to the brick experiment.@Jake the Brick
Finn@Oh. Sorry, man.@Jake the Brick
Jake@Forget about the bunny.@Jake the Brick
Finn@Sorry, man.@Jake the Brick
BMO@Sorry, Jake.@Jake the Brick
Finn@Look, we'll, uh, we'll leave you alone.@Jake the Brick
Jake@Finn? Are you still there? Finn? BMO?@Jake the Brick
Jake@Mr. Bunny retreats to its warren. Its homemade comfort is some consolation to help pass the hungry night. Twilight falls on the peaceful forest, a twilight unaware of the struggles it both soothes and conceals. The crickets begin to stir, rehearsing their musical rhapsodies. In the distance, flashes of heat lightning illuminate a purple summer sky. Even angry deer, at last, must come to rest. And so it is with our erstwhile antagonist, who has disappeared into a stand of trees, perhaps to dream of tomorrow's pointless battles.@Jake the Brick
Jake@Oh, my Gob, it's a crazy storm! This might be it! This weather might knock the whole thing down!@Jake the Brick
Jake@If a definition of bravery exists, then this must be it. A lone bunny, facing off against the elements, ineffectually pushing around some twigs with his pink bunny nose, a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but sometimes that's all we have. The wind is beginning to pick up. It's becoming clear that Mother Nature has not just knocked on the door, she has come in, sat down, and poured herself a drink. Mr. Bunny has no friends, no family, no loved ones of any kind. The wind is really picking up now. Small puddles gathering around the entrance to Mr. Bunny's cozy home are beginning to grow in size and connect with one another. It won't be long now. But what's this?! Looks like this unflagging little hero of a bunny will have some help, though! A family of friendly beavers appears to have taken up the cause.@Jake the Brick
Jake@Often called nature's architects, these intrepid mammals are sparing no effort to shore up the endangered burrow. Here's an unusual sight. It's a Sea Lard! You'd expect to see a few mudscamps out in weather like this, but here we have a rare treat indeed. This little beauty is pretty far outside of her natural habitat, but I've heard it said by wise old salts schooled in ancient maritime lore that storms will sometimes blow them off course to a remarkable degree. Looks like we've got some pretty good evidence tonight. Yes, sir, sometimes those old sailors know what they're talking about. It's a triumph of experience versus the secondhand verities of musty academic tomes. This feisty Sea Lard is pitchin' right in to save the rabbit hole, belying its slothful reputation. She uses her prodigious swiveling behind to increase the size of the hole, while the beavers continue to reinforce the sides with straw and stick. Times like these, supposed cruelty and indifference of the natural world, all too often its most salient feature, pale before the nobler instincts of even our most humble kin.@Jake the Brick
Jake@In the morning light, few signs remain of the summer storm that battered this idyllic glen. The beavers are finished with their work and are heading home. The Sea Lard looks like she's gonna wander the woods for a while. Maybe she'll find her way back to the ocean and write a novel about her experiences. Mr. Bunny is exhausted but can rest easy knowing that his home is secure. But alas, the bunny's rest is short-lived. The deer is back.@Jake the Brick
Jake@The deer, perhaps confused by the antler-like appearance of Mr. Bunny's protective dam, is now testing the situation.@Jake the Brick
Jake@The bunny is unsure of where this is going.@Jake the Brick
Jake@And with a single smash from the deer's powerful front hooves, the bunny's home is under attack! Mr. Bunny has hopped to safety and can only watch as the deer continues its relentless rampage on the only home he knows. A couple more mighty smashes, and the dam—the dam has been breached! Water is now flooding in! The deer continues its attack! This deer's misplaced rage, combined with its size and weight, is more than enough to bring down the weakened walls, which are now starting to give, aided by the unforgiving weigh from the tree above. Even Mr. Deer, in his blind fury, seems to sense what's about to happen as he steps to one side!@Jake the Brick
Jake@It's over. The warren has been destroyed.@Jake the Brick
Jake@An injustice of astronomical levels. Words fail me.@Jake the Brick
Jake@Actually, he doesn't seem that upset.@Jake the Brick
Jake@He's on his feet, checking out his new surroundings—even the deer is impressed! As if confused by the events, he performs a comical double-take and retreats into the forest. Ladies and gentlemen, this bunny is indomitable!@Jake the Brick
Jake@This bunny has the right attitude. Who cares about being a brick in a wall of a fallen-down shack? There's something bigger than that, and the bunny has answers. Teach me, Mr. B!@Jake the Brick
Jake@Aw.@Jake the Brick
Finn@Jake? Jake? You there, buddy? Over.@Jake the Brick
Jake@Hey, Finn.@Jake the Brick
Finn@Hey, man. You ready to come home?@Jake the Brick
Jake@That sounds good.@Jake the Brick
Finn@Awesome. See you soon. Yus!@Jake the Brick
Jake@Blegh. Your tooth looks bad, dude. It smells like a garden shed in here.@Dentist
Jake@Finn, I think you have to go dentist.@Dentist
Finn@I can't go dentist, Jake. You gotta take care of it.@Dentist
Jake@Just go dentist, dude. Okay. Easy does it.@Dentist
Jake@This is so bad. What did Princess Bubblegum say when you showed her?@Dentist
Finn@Ahhhhhhhhhh.@Dentist
Princess Bubblegum@Hmm. Finn, this is literally serious. You have to go dentist.@Dentist
Finn@NOOOOOO!@Dentist
Jake@Dude. You. Got. To. Go. Dentist.@Dentist
Finn@Nooooo! I'm too strong for the world! I don't want to go dentist, Jake. The put you in a hole filled with snakes and rotten butter and they leave you there.@Dentist
Jake@Come on, man. It's not that bad.@Dentist
Finn@Okay.@Dentist
Jake@Right?@Dentist
Jake@Whup!@Dentist
Finn@This isn't so bad... My sword! Wonder wh—@Dentist
Finn@Soft sand. Ant.@Dentist
Ant@Welcome to dentist, cadet. I'm Lieutenant Gamergate. Snakes and rotten butter. A common mistake—you were expected to arrive with snacks and a flashlight. Either way, you're here.@Dentist
Finn@So... dentist is ants?@Dentist
Gamergate@Dentist is dentist, cadet! Drop and give me twenty!@Dentist
Finn@I don't have any money.@Dentist
Gamergate@Funny man goes dentist, huh? The queen's office is in the royal hill.@Dentist
Finn@Holes. Hmm.@Dentist
Queen@Listen, I wasn't here when you came in. I'm a very busy woman. Hello. My name is General Tarsal. I am the current queen of this regiment, and please have a seat.@Dentist
General Tarsal@As a first-time recruit, I'm confident that you have no idea what you're doing here.@Dentist
Finn@My tooth hurts.@Dentist
General Tarsal@Let's take a look at your file. Ahh, you're a fighter! We could use a fighter.@Dentist
Finn@My tooth hurts.@Dentist
General Tarsal@What? Of course it does. Let me explain. You have gone dentist. That means that you will server a brief tour of duty, and in exchange we will provide full dental rehabilitation. You will be on the front, fighting monsters. Monstrous monster worms!@Dentist
Finn@Worms.@Dentist
General Tarsal@The worms are employed by the flies.@Dentist
Finn@Worms.@Dentist
General Tarsal@Work for the flies. You fight them; we'll fix your teeth.@Dentist
Finn@Me.@Dentist
General Tarsal@Yes, you! Your mission is to secure this junction at all costs. Upon completion of service, you will be sworn to absolute secrecy. The flies have spies everywhere. Fly spies!@Dentist
Finn@Heh heh.@Dentist
General Tarsal@These worms are no joke, so you'll be assigned a partner. Ah, let's see... Cadet... Tiffany Oiler.@Dentist
Finn@Tiffany?!@Dentist
Tiffany@Tiffany! Finn, I'm gonna kill you!@Dentist
Finn@That guy wants to kill me!@Dentist
General Tarsal@Tough nuts, that's dentist.@Dentist
Loudspeaker@Cadets, dinner is being served in the mess hall, central hill subtunnel eight.@Dentist
Finn@Hm. Do you have anything less sugary?@Dentist
Tiffany@Yo, Finn! I'm gonna kill you!@Dentist
Finn@Doin' it for my tooth.@Dentist
Tiffany@Ruff! Thought so.@Dentist
Finn@Hey, uh, partner. Um. So how are you doing, Tiffany?@Dentist
Tiffany@Yeah, I lost my teeth eating the Baker's Shard. It's a lot of sugar, right?@Dentist
Finn@Oh. Did you already know what dentist is?@Dentist
Tiffany@See, this is a good example of why I want to kill you. You're ignorant. Heed my words, Finn. As the miller's wheel forever outrages the seed, so the good apple boringly receives his neighbor's worm.@Dentist
Finn@The hey?@Dentist
Tiffany@And all the corn gets smushed to grease—to grease under the miller's fleaping wheel.@Dentist
Tiffany@You're getting greased!@Dentist
Finn@Tiffany, look. We gotta work together, right? Why don't we let bygones be bygones?@Dentist
Tiffany@Bygones? Ha! That's you. Bye! Gone!@Dentist
Finn@Do you want my peach?@Dentist
Tiffany@Bye-gone!@Dentist
Gamergate@Hey! Stand down, cadets! Retire to your bunks!@Dentist
Tiffany@Tonight, light's out. Tomorrow, your eyes out!@Dentist
Finn@What the stork, man? This is my special sword. Why didn't you take one of those ant swords they offered you back there?@Dentist
Tiffany@I don't need some fancy thinger to kick butt when I've got these! You know about these?@Dentist
Finn@No.@Dentist
Tiffany@You will. Anyway, I just kinda wanted your sword 'cause it's pretty cool, I guess. Whatever. I'll get it soon enough... from off your dead corpse, you chump!@Dentist
Finn@Hey, Tiffany... you know, we're really not so different, you and I.@Dentist
Tiffany@Bullstuff.@Dentist
Finn@Well, we're both friends with Jake, and that's something, right?@Dentist
Tiffany@I was friends with Jake. Then some baritone herb stole him away from me.@Dentist
Finn@I didn't steal him. We're broth—@Dentist
Tiffany@And when that snow-white wiener dog is finally dead, Jake will be devastated.@Dentist
Tiffany@He'll need a shoulder to cry whiny, Finn-style tears on, and that shoulder will be mine—Tiffany's! Then I can get busy with undoing your cheesy influence, plus more! With my help, Jake will become the criminal juggernaut he was always meant to be.@Dentist
Tiffany@We won't just be robbing banks anymore.@Dentist
Tiffany@We'll be robbing the actual banks. The whole banks!@Dentist
Tiffany@You get it? We're gonna steal actual whole buildings.@Dentist
Finn@Yeah, I get it.@Dentist
Tiffany@So don't tell me we're not so different, okay?! We're opposites, you and me. Oil and goody-goody snow-white baby-vanilla bean mitten water! Go, Tiffany!@Dentist
Finn@Man, that nut's gonna try and stick me while I'm not even looking. Don't even stress it, Finn. You're Finn Mertens, man. You got this. Man, I hope so.@Dentist
Tiffany@Finn! Get in here, quick!@Dentist
Finn@The junction.@Dentist
Tiffany@There's something moving in the walls. It was like .@Dentist
Finn@Wall worms! Holy cow!@Dentist
Finn@Dang it, Tiffany, not yet! We got to work together to beat the worms! Here they come!@Dentist
Finn@Tiffany!@Dentist
Finn & Tiffany@Oh, snap! Look out! They're coming in from the side!@Dentist
Tiffany@You good?@Dentist
Finn@My tooth hurts.@Dentist
Finn@Dang! It's the head worm, and she's livid! I say we get the heck out of heeeeere—!@Dentist
Tiffany@Finn!@Dentist
Finn@Tiffany, quick! Pull me up! Quick, Tiffany! I'm slipping!@Dentist
Finn@Dang it, Tiffany! Weren't you paying attention? We're two peas in a pod! We're not oil and water. We're oil and vinegar! It's good, man. It's yummy!@Dentist
Tiffany@Mm...@Dentist
Finn@It's good for you!@Dentist
Tiffany@You're right, Finn. I can't bring myself to do it...@Dentist
Tiffany@...but I can't bring myself to save you, either.@Dentist
Tiffany@Why are you still smiling?@Dentist
Finn@Sorry. I didn't hear what you said. I was just gonna let it slide.@Dentist
Tiffany@Look, you're—you're on your own. I'm sorry.@Dentist
Tiffany@Catch you on the flip, I guess.@Dentist
Finn@Tiffany? Tiffa— nooooooooo!@Dentist
General Tarsal@Whoa! Easy, son. Don't try to speak. Your mouth is full of ants.@Dentist
Finn@Huh?@Dentist
Ant@It's okay. We just finished up.@Dentist
Finn@Ah. What happened down there? Where's Tiffany?@Dentist
General Tarsal@Well, the good news is the worm queen was defeated, choked to death on some foreign object, presumably Cadet Tiffany, who is missing in action, which is the bad news.@Dentist
Finn@Tiffany...@Dentist
General Tarsal@But we didn't have to fix his teeth, which is nice news. But we did have to fix your teeth, which is okay news.@Dentist
Finn@Huh huh. Ayyyy!@Dentist
General Tarsal@So, on behalf of the ant nation, I'd like to thank you for your service, which is now concluded. As soon as you're ready, we'll get you stuffed back up there well with all the snakes and butter.@Dentist
Finn@Holy cow.@Dentist
Princess Bubblegum@Welcome home, Finn.@Dentist
Jake@Yeah. Welcome home, buddy.@Dentist
Finn@Thanks, you guys! Man, you'll never believe it. Dentist is actually—@Dentist
Princess Bubblegum@Eh-eh-eh!@Dentist
Finn@It was crazy! Tiffany was there—@Dentist
Starchie@Hey, deh-deh-deh!@Dentist
Finn@Wait. You all knew? What the heck? Why didn't you tell—@Dentist
Jake@Ah-ah-ah!@Dentist
Flame Person@Brrrr. It's freezing in here. Whoa, I'm losing a lot of weight! Calorie control and modern exercise are the key. But I don't do any of those things, so this is weird. Hmm...@The Cooler
Flame Guard@My jets are tiny! No one look at my tiny jets!@The Cooler
Flame Person@At least your body is normal, man. My body isn't hot anymore!@The Cooler
Flame Person@What's going on, man? I'm scared!@The Cooler
Flame Person@Give me a hug, man! I don't know! Aaaaaah! Nooooo! My baby brooooo!@The Cooler
Flame Princess@It's as I feared. The magma in the kingdom's core is cooling down, weakening the life force of our Flame Citizens. I've gathered you here to figure out how to stop this. We need ideas, people!@The Cooler
Randy@I'll do my best, sis!@The Cooler
Flame Princess@Randy, you are here to stay safe only. Eat your snacks.@The Cooler
Randy@I'll do my best, sis.@The Cooler
Agnes@Perhaps everyone can form into a big love hug to stay warm!@The Cooler
Flame Princess@That's ridiculous, aunt Agnes.@The Cooler
Agnes@I'm not that smart.@The Cooler
Flame Princess' older brother@Blow up the Candy Kingdom! I've been saying this for months now! And I'll say it again! Let's blow 'em up with their stockpile of you know whats! We've debated this too long!@The Cooler
Agnes@But why the Candy Kingdom?@The Cooler
Flame Princess' older brother@Their sugar burns hotter and faster with lots of extra calories. Don't make me wait, sister! Also, is it safe to talk about in front of the C-I-N-N-A-M-O-N B-U-N?@The Cooler
Flame Princess@Cinnamon Bun, what are you doing?@The Cooler
Cinnamon Bun@My nose itches!@The Cooler
Flame Princess@You don't have a nose.@The Cooler
Cinnamon Bun@What?@The Cooler
Flame Princess@Well, whatever it is, it won't go away if you don't stop fiddling with it.@The Cooler
Flame Princess' older brother@Blow up the Candy Kingdom! They are trash people!@The Cooler
Flame Princess@I'm prepared to do what I need to as a leader. Nothing is off the table, but we need Princess Bubblegum as an ally right now. She might be able to help us solve this.@The Cooler
Flame Princess' older brother@Very well. Randy, send them an ultimatum! Help us or die!@The Cooler
Randy@Randy is on it!@The Cooler
Cinnamon Bun@Princess!@The Cooler
Flame Princess' older brother@Yeah, pump those legs, Randy!@The Cooler
Flame Princess@Quickly, CB, take me to the core entrance.@The Cooler
Cinnamon Bun@Okay!@The Cooler
Flame Princess@Hello, Bubblegum. Thank you for coming.@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@I'm glad you sent for me, and please, call me Bonnibel! Hey, what's your first—?@The Cooler
Flame Princess@Don't act like you're my friend, PB! You're here to help save my kingdom, not because I trust you.@The Cooler
Flame Princess@We're in the midst of unnatural cold season, but the cause has us stumped. My people are really freaking out.@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@Yeah, my subjects tend to panic in crisis situations, too. It's tough; a ruler's got to deal with a lot of subservient dummies.@The Cooler
Flame Princess@Hmmm...@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@Whoa! Whoa! Hold up. My Mondometer is going cuckoo. Where does this lead?@The Cooler
Flame Princess@Behind these doors are the most secret relics in the Fire Kingdom. Forbidden to outsiders. Come on.@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@Well, whatever is back there is kicking out mondo energy levels. It could have something to do with the cooling.@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@Do you wanna save your kingdom or not?@The Cooler
Flame Princess@Alright, but don't touch anything! These are the sleeping Fire Giants. They're the ancient protectors of the Fire Kingdom. Their existence is known only to those of the royal line, and their story has been passed down through the generations.@The Cooler
Flame Princess@With them, I can remake a white-hot new Fire Kingdom. They are our last resort, our greatest weapons. Huh? Hey! I said "no touching"!@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@What? Oh, no no no! This little geothermic control module, or whatever it is, accidentally fell out. I was just putting it back!@The Cooler
Flame Princess@Huh, strange. The access panel's lock must have corroded.@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@Yeah, ancient technology's always falling apart. Oh! The readings are over here now!@The Cooler
Flame Princess@What?!@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@Okay, let me explain. These bad boys are just too dangerous to remain functional, and I can't risk you or your bananas brother using them, especially now that you've lost most of your powers. So let me just finish disarming...@The Cooler
Flame Princess@You are way out of line, Bubblegum! You have no control here! I do!@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@Aah! Shield, shield!@The Cooler
Flame Princess@Nooooo!@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@Hey, nice shot! Ya ding dong!@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@Cloak.@The Cooler
Flame Princess@Come out in the open and face me like a princess!@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@The Fire Kingdom has always been a threat to my realm!@The Cooler
Flame Princess@So that gives you the right to donk up my people's future?! I won't let you continue to usurp my authority!@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@And I can't leave my people's safety to chance!@The Cooler
Flame Princess@Why can't you just trust me?!@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@'Cause you're a ding dong. I've got to do whatever it takes to protect my peeps.@The Cooler
Flame Princess@So be it.@The Cooler
Flame Princess@You're never going to change, are you? You'll just keep walking all over us little people! But not today.@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@Shields off. Okay, I'll come clean.@The Cooler
Flame Princess@Yeah, right.@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@It was me. I messed with the core temperature to get in here. I had to get near your weapon stockpile.@The Cooler
Flame Princess@But how did you find out about them?@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@Ummm...@The Cooler
Cinnamon Bun@Wait... Wow, my nose is disgusting!@The Cooler
Flame Princess@You're still spying on me?@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@I'm PB! I spy on everybody. No big D!@The Cooler
Flame Princess@You're cold, PB!@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@Eh.@The Cooler
Flame Princess@And it's not because you're a scientist or leader; it's because you are a bad person! Something inside you is messed up, girl. And whatever it is, whatever, whatever, PB!@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@Okay, keep one last fire giant. I'm not a bad person. I want you to see that. I promise.@The Cooler
Flame Princess@You better not be fibbing. It's Phoebe. My first name is Phoebe. You, uh, asked earlier.@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@Ice King, call it off.@The Cooler
Ice King@Roger that, Princess.@The Cooler
Flame Guard@My jets! Yes!@The Cooler
Flame Person@Oh no!@The Cooler
Flame Princess' older brother@I was gonna blow up stuff! It was going to be cool!@The Cooler
Princess Bubblegum@Hmmm...@The Cooler
Flame Princess' older brother@We were going to war!@The Cooler
Finn@Tree Trunks! The slumber party is about to start. Get those hot buns in here, girl!@The Pajama War
Finn@Did you hear me? I said, "Get those hot—"!@The Pajama War
Finn@Hi, Mr. Pig.@The Pajama War
Finn@Why are you hitting me?@The Pajama War
Finn@I was just talking about Tree Trunks's hot—.@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Come on, Finn! We're doing music chairs.@The Pajama War
Chet@Everyone ready?@The Pajama War
Everyone@Ready!@The Pajama War
Chet@Take a seat!@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Uh, uh...@The Pajama War
Finn@Uh-oh, uh-oh!@The Pajama War
Mr. Cupcake@There's a seat by me.@The Pajama War
Finn & Princess Bubblegum@Oh! Heh.@The Pajama War
Finn@You take it, Princess. This is your party.@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@You take it, Finn. You're my guest.@The Pajama War
Finn & Princess Bubblegum@No, no, I insist!@The Pajama War
Chet@Time is up. You two must now be sent to the closest closet to have heavenly thoughts.@The Pajama War
Chet@Heavenly thoughts.@The Pajama War
Finn@Hey, PB.@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Hey, Finn.@The Pajama War
Finn@Mm?@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Bup, bup, bup. Hey, you wanna ditch the party and go for a walk?@The Pajama War
Finn@Wha—? Really?@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@It's been a while since we just hung out, you know?@The Pajama War
Finn@What about the Candy People?@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Ah, they should be fine, right? For once? Maybe they'll surprise me by being fine. Come on.@The Pajama War
Finn@Whoa!@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Secret passage.@The Pajama War
Finn@Noice.@The Pajama War
Manfried@Boy, it's sure quiet in there. What's going on in there, you think?@The Pajama War
Crunchy@Someone should listen at the door.@The Pajama War
Mr. Cupcake@We nominate you, Crunchy, to go listen at the door.@The Pajama War
Dr. Donut@And tell everybody what's going on.@The Pajama War
Crunchy@Eh, what? Why me?@The Pajama War
Starchie@Come on, Crunchy. You're the go-to guy. You're the new Cinnamon Bun.@The Pajama War
Crunchy@No, I'm not.@The Pajama War
Gumdrop Lass 1@What do you hear?@The Pajama War
Dr. Donut@Yeah, paint us a picture, Crunchy.@The Pajama War
Crunchy@I hear, like, uh, like, a lush, green field... next to a white picket fence. Finn and the princess both brought picnic baskets. Oh, but they brought the same stuff, and they're laughing about it. And now they're kissing.@The Pajama War
Chocoberry@There's no lush, green field in that closet!@The Pajama War
Crunchy@Well, you guys asked me to paint a picture.@The Pajama War
Chocoberry@Just tell us what you hear!@The Pajama War
Crunchy@I can't hear anything. They must be just lightly brushing their lips together.@The Pajama War
Starchie@Or... maybe they kissed so much they passed out! Crunchy, open that door!@The Pajama War
Mr. Cupcake@Step aside, Crunchy. I'll make short work of this door opening. Oh. I guess I'm just too strong.@The Pajama War
Gumdrop Lass 1@Then they're trapped! What if they ran out of air?@The Pajama War
Mr. Cupcake@No air? I'll smash down the door!@The Pajama War
Chet@Stop!@The Pajama War
Mr. Cupcake@Huh?@The Pajama War
Chet@Mr. Cupcake, your mighty strength might kill them! There's a drill and saw in the supply room, though.@The Pajama War
Mr. Cupcake@In here, you say?@The Pajama War
Candy People@No, don't!@The Pajama War
Candy People@Aw...@The Pajama War
Jake@Yo, guys! You gotta do something! That's my best friend in there! "You okay in there?"@The Pajama War
Finn@Yeah, we went out the secret coat passage.@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@It's so nice to get away sometimes.@The Pajama War
Finn@Hmm. Candy peeps can be a handful, huh?@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Yeah. They mean well, though. You wanna meet Timmy?@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Timmy!@The Pajama War
Finn@Aw! So squish!@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Hop on!@The Pajama War
Finn@Okay.@The Pajama War
Candy People@Breathe!@The Pajama War
Candy People@Breathe!@The Pajama War
Candy People@Breathe!@The Pajama War
Chet@Wait. Wait! Don't Candy People breathe out, like, poisonous gas or something? Something like... carbo... carrin dio—@The Pajama War
Jake@I know! It's called... And it is deadly.@The Pajama War
Chocoberry@Suck it back out! Suck it back out!@The Pajama War
Chet@Cupcake's dead! What do we do?!@The Pajama War
Jake@Ha-a.@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@So got any other weekend plans?@The Pajama War
Finn@Mmm... probably gonna hit up the arts and crafts kingdom with BMO. You?@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Oh, I'm gonna garden some, plan next week's pizza lunch, answer 800 e-mails, and... you know, whatever.@The Pajama War
Finn@Wows. Do you ever get tired from doing princess work all the time?@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Sure. I mean, it's a lot of responsibility looking after so many people, though lately I have been trying to be more chill about it.@The Pajama War
Finn@Cool, like taking ice cream breaks?@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Yeah, and, like, being more... sorta okay with everyone making mistakes around me. Like "mind my own stuff" more. You know what I mean?@The Pajama War
Finn@Yeah. Kind of like how I've been thinking about my dad and how I want him to act more like daddy. But, but maybe acting like daddy just isn't what he does. Maybe my dad's not a dad but a kid stuck in a dad's body.@The Pajama War
Finn@Timmy knows what's up!@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Timmy!@The Pajama War
Finn & Princess Bubblegum@Timmy!@The Pajama War
Manfried@Okey-dokey, everybody! Check it out!@The Pajama War
Manfried@Once in place, this sweater will muffle the cannonball explosion perfectly, allowing the frame around the door to gently fall apart, freeing Finn and PB.@The Pajama War
Mr. Cupcake@Manfried's a good leader because we can always see him.@The Pajama War
Manfried@Now the cannon should go right over here. Oh, wait. Here.@The Pajama War
Chocoberry@Aren't you worried about Finn?@The Pajama War
Jake@Of course I am! See these tears of worry?@The Pajama War
Chocoberry@It will be okay, Jake.@The Pajama War
Finn (voiceover)@PB is showing me all this cool stuff. She has an awesome shirt. How's the party?@The Pajama War
Manfried@Okay, everyone, prepare for the boom.@The Pajama War
Manfried@Three... two...@The Pajama War
Colonel Candy Corn@Fire!@The Pajama War
Colonel Candy Corn@Aw, my cannon.@The Pajama War
Manfried@Uh-oh.@The Pajama War
Banana Guard@Hey, the closet's open!@The Pajama War
Crunchy@So they're dead, right?@The Pajama War
Ice Cream Guy@Chocoberry can tell us! She saw a ghost at my house once.@The Pajama War
Chocoberry@Oui, it's true. I have the gift. Yes. I sense their spirits.@The Pajama War
Chocoberry@Finn says... He says, "Remember to feed BMO." @The Pajama War
Colonel Candy Corn@That idea stank, Manfried! I'm calling the shots from now on.@The Pajama War
Mr. Cupcake@No! Manfried is still the most clearly visible.@The Pajama War
Jake@Hey, why don't you guys team up and fight each other to see who gets to wear the crown.@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Here, try this one.@The Pajama War
Finn@Mmm... fire.@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@You got a little edible fire mustache there.@The Pajama War
Finn@What? Gonna send this to Jake.@The Pajama War
Jake (voiceover)@Check it out.@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Hey, what's that?@The Pajama War
Finn@Uh, it's—@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Let me see.@The Pajama War
Finn@Mm. You won't like it, but okay.@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@I'll worry about it later.@The Pajama War
Finn@Oh.@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@You wanna see the burrito room?@The Pajama War
Finn@Yuss!@The Pajama War
Colonel Candy Corn@This is a brutal new society. For a society to function, it needs rules. 1. You must drink tea with your pizza. 2. Pizza can only be eaten alone. 3. If a pizza is found in a field, you must make the next person you see holding a glass of milk eat it.@The Pajama War
Crunchy@Sire, I must congratulate you on becoming princess.@The Pajama War
Colonel Candy Corn@Thank you.@The Pajama War
Crunchy@Is there anything I can do or get for you?@The Pajama War
Colonel Candy Corn@Anything?@The Pajama War
Crunchy@Anything.@The Pajama War
Colonel Candy Corn@Could you perhaps procure a pizza?@The Pajama War
Crunchy@Yes.@The Pajama War
Jake@Man, this is intense. I better do something!@The Pajama War
Finn@Thanks for showing me around, PB. I've enjoyed just, just hanging out.@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Me, too!@The Pajama War
Finn@Jake just sent me a funny picture of himself.@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Whoa. It looks like the Candy People's makeshift government has been taken over by a ruthless despot.@The Pajama War
Finn@What? Why aren't you freaking out?@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Eh, it was worth giving them a shot. Let's go back to the party, though. It looks like we have to save it.@The Pajama War
Colonel Candy Corn@Neigh! Whinny!@The Pajama War
Candy People@Crunchy! Crunchy! Crunchy!@The Pajama War
Crunchy@To the crater!@The Pajama War
Crunchy@Any last words, Starchie?@The Pajama War
Starchie@You smell.@The Pajama War
Crunchy@Throw him in!@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@What's going on here?@The Pajama War
Candy People@Uh...@The Pajama War
Jake@They devolved into beasts. It has hilarious.@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Okay, everybody get into your sleeping bags, and I'll read you a story.@The Pajama War
Princess Bubblegum@Modern menswear can be traced back two hundred years. Furs and textiles became easier to produce...@The Pajama War
Gunther@Stop, demon! Get back here, I say! Ha ha, nowhere to run. I, the great and powerful Urgence Evergreen, command you to freeze into a million pieces and leave young Gunther alone!@Evergreen
Gunther@Foolish demon, you leave me no choice. Zap, zap zap zap zap! What?@Evergreen
Gunther@No, Nina! You're supposed to be frozen. Nina!@Evergreen
Gunther@Nina, the portals! The Elementals are gathering! C'mon, you blockhead!@Evergreen
Chatsberry@I just think we should discuss this, Evergreen.@Evergreen
Evergreen@"Discuss"?! Are you listening, Chatsberry? Once this comet hits, everybody dies. Not just everybody, but us, but us!@Evergreen
Balthus@Now, now, hold on, Evergreen. Hath not a comet impacted our world every thousand years with no lasting grievousness?@Evergreen
Evergreen@Ahh, but this, Balthus, is no ordinary comet. Behold!@Evergreen
Evergreen@See how it writhes? It aches for our extinction. It—!@Evergreen
Chatsberry@But Evergreen, even if the comet is as dangerous as you say, what can we possibly do?@Evergreen
Evergreen@We build a crown.@Evergreen
Chatsberry@"A crown"?@Evergreen
Evergreen@Like none seen before, or ever after! A magical crown whose phantasmal circuitry will bond to its first bearer and grant him his one deepest wish... to destroy the hideous comet which threatens our world! The good news is I already built the crown. The bad news it needs a power source. The enchanted Ruby Eyes of the ancient lava dog, Magwood! And that's where you come in.@Evergreen
Chatsberry@Wait, wait! Evergreen, please. Wish Magic is really the real deal! This wish may see things in you you cannot see yourself. Can you truly say you know your heart's truest desire?@Evergreen
Balthus@I'm with Chatsberry. If this comet hits, we four indeed may perish. But the Elements we embody — Fire, Ice, Candy, and Slime — will live on! But a misplaced wish could cause irreversible damage to the very structure of existence!@Evergreen
Evergreen@Well, that's just great. What about you, Slimy D?@Evergreen
Slimy D@Yo, yo. My name's Slimy D, and I'm here to—@Evergreen
Balthus@Slimy D stands with us.@Evergreen
Chatsberry@We reject your plan, Urgence Evergreen!@Evergreen
Evergreen@Very well then. You leave me no choice.@Evergreen
Chatsberry@Urgence! Stop! You'll doom us... all!@Evergreen
Evergreen@Hmm! Doom you to no doom, maybe! Gunther! Pack my things, Gunther. We ride forth with Mount Magwood. You get to watch me save the world! Gunther! Come on, Gunther. Get your head in the game.@Evergreen
Gunther@Sorry, Master Evergreen.@Evergreen
Evergreen@And he expects me to teach him the ways of magic? As if.@Evergreen
Gunther@Ouch! Oof! OUCH! Uh, Master Evergreen? Can I ride on the palanquin with you? My feet are soft. No, you're right. Ooh, boy...@Evergreen
Gunther@Gettin' fat. Gettin' fat, right?@Evergreen
Evergreen@Hmm.@Evergreen
Gunther@However, I would suggest this is still a nice night. It's quiet.@Evergreen
Evergreen@Hmm, it is quiet. Why don't you put on some music? The chimes, Gunther.@Evergreen
Gunther@Okay.@Evergreen
Evergreen@Gunther! I said "chimes"! Gunther, no! @Evergreen
Gunther@Sorry, Master, I'll put him back.@Evergreen
Ice Imp@Heeeeey! Mmm, what?@Evergreen
Evergreen@Oh, never mind. Here, take the jar and find me some water. There's not enough moisture in the air for me to make an ice camp.@Evergreen
Gunther@Uh, Master? I'm sorry, I don't think I've seen any water at all today.@Evergreen
Evergreen@Just do it. Don't anger Daddy.@Evergreen
Gunther@Wait, are you my father?@Evergreen
Evergreen@No, but I stole your egg and mutated your brain—get going!@Evergreen
Gunther@Hmm.@Evergreen
Gunther@Heh, you don't know where you're going, do you, girl? Ah, you're good at this. Man, you know who I like? Master Evergreen. He can do anything; one thing he's gonna do—he said he's gonna teach me magic. I can be like him!@Evergreen
Gunther@Nina, no!@Evergreen
Gunther@Master Evergreen, I found the water so you could build a—oh, I guess he also found water, too.@Evergreen
Ice Imp@Heeeeey?!@Evergreen
Evergreen@Now, Gunther, listen to me. Don't follow me into Magwood's lair or else he'll melt your dome!@Evergreen
Gunther@Yeah...@Evergreen
Evergreen@Oh, Gunther! You should see this!@Evergreen
Gunther@Okay!@Evergreen
Evergreen@Gunther, no! You failed; he'll melt your dome.@Evergreen
Evergreen@Not as grand as you once were, eh?@Evergreen
Gunther@Master Evergreen, I'm sorry, but I got worried. Yeeeee!!@Evergreen
Gunther@Ah! Oh, boy! Uh, maybe maybe maybe, maybe I can do magic! Like Master Evergreen. Bah! Ice! Flah, sorry...@Evergreen
Gunther@Shh!@Evergreen
Ice Imp@That's what you get! Heeeey....@Evergreen
Evergreen@Ice!@Evergreen
Evergreen@This is why I don't teach you magic.@Evergreen
Gunther@Niiina, Hiiina, Iiiina, Fiiina—@Evergreen
Evergreen@Gunther! The heck are you doing?! Get in here, Gunther! Oh, there you are, you blockhead. Quickly, take your position. We have precious little time. Once I complete the bonding chant, you deactivate the force field. Bonding, bonding, three two one, you can do it, you can do it, three two one, bonding bonding. I did it! I— Come on, now, what did I ever do to you?! Watch the columns, stupid! Whoops! Easy now... Oh, wow, did you see that?! Ow, my bread balls!@Evergreen
Evergreen@Gunther?! Gunther, can you hear me?!@Evergreen
Gunther@Yeah—yes, Master Evergreen!@Evergreen
Evergreen@Okay, good. Now, aiming at the sound of my voice, throw the crown so it lands right on the top of my head.@Evergreen
Gunther@I—wait, what?@Evergreen
Evergreen@No, no, there's no time! It must be you, Gunther!@Evergreen
Gunther@Me?@Evergreen
Evergreen@Don't worry, it's easy. Even a mush-head like you couldn't donk it up too bad. Just focus on your deepest truest wish, the destruction of the deadly comet, and the rest will take care of itself.@Evergreen
Gunther@My deepest truest wish... Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no!@Evergreen
Evergreen@Gunther? Buddy? What are you wishing for down there? Gunther... no... That's the wrong wish! You've got to snap out of it! Use a concentration spell or, or a basic focusing charm—like I taught you... I mean, like I meant to teach you... I--@Evergreen
Ice King@Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, noooooo! . Mornin'. Man, what a dream. Do you guys ever have the dino-boy dream with the astero-- what? What... what is it? Something in my teeth? Something in my hair? Something in my nose? Something in my ear?@Evergreen
Finn@Jake, so I just had this weird thought.@Astral Plane
Jake@Well, that's normal; people always have weird thoughts around campfires.@Astral Plane
Finn@Well, I don't know. Isn't is sort of strange that we keep pets? We kind of make them worship us.@Astral Plane
Jake@What?! Nah.@Astral Plane
Finn@No, seriously, think about it. We're their only source of food and water and, like, tummy rubs. They basically have to love us.@Astral Plane
Jake@What's wrong with tummy rubs?@Astral Plane
Finn@Yeah, tummy rubs are pretty great. That one star is so crazy, looks like it's vibrating. It's so cool. Wonder what it is, a planet? Do people live there? Are they friendly? Do they keep pets?@Astral Plane
Jake@Alright buddy, that's a little too much campfire. Time for bed.@Astral Plane
Finn@Whoa... holy. Oh, dang. Uh, okay. Man, this is screwy. Maybe it's the can of beans we had for dinner. Looks- uh- homey. Wuh-oh! Whoa-Aah! Oh- right.@Astral Plane
Mr. Fox@Mmm, Boobafinna, just pay me back when you can.@Astral Plane
Finn@Aww.@Astral Plane
Astral Mr. Fox@Hello?@Astral Plane
Finn@Oh! Hey, you can see me?!@Astral Plane
Astral Mr. Fox@See you...? But if I didn't see you... Wait, what did you originally ask me?@Astral Plane
Finn@Oh, forget it, it's cool.@Astral Plane
Astral Mr. Fox@Do you, want a drink or something? I think I only have water anyway. .@Astral Plane
Finn@Whoop, here I go! Bye!@Astral Plane
Astral Mr. Fox@Oh, that was sort of rude. I hope he comes back.@Astral Plane
Finn@That guy seemed lonely, not a lot of foxes up at this hour. Guess you get a lot of work done though.@Astral Plane
Bounce House Princess@Quittin' time! You don't have to go home but ya', oh, you know how it goes!@Astral Plane
Finn@Bounce House Princess. . I didn't know B.H.P lived in a cave. Hey, this place is pretty nice.@Astral Plane
Finn@Whoa!@Astral Plane
Bounce House Princess@Forty-one, forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, forty-five. forty-six, four-seven, fourth-eight, forty-nine... fifty! . Fifty-one, fifty-two . Who's there?!@Astral Plane
Bounce House Princess@Oh my glob, oh my glob, oh my glob, oh my glob! six four three two one! .@Astral Plane
Finn@Dude, what's your deal?@Astral Plane
Bounce House Princess@Everything's okay now.@Astral Plane
Finn@Aww, geez, poor Bounce House Princess.@Astral Plane
Finn@Wha?@Astral Plane
Bounce House Princess@Bounce House Princess, you listen to me! Are you gonna' shut yourself off from other people forever?! I mean he or she could be really nice and- okay, mm, maybe if I just say very still, it'll just- it will just go away.@Astral Plane
Finn@Gosh, I hope BHP's okay, I feel bad for just splittin' like that. Maybe they sorted it out, they could have stuff in common. You never know until you speak to the person. Oh, hey, Cloud Kingdom.@Astral Plane
Finn@What the? Ice King?@Astral Plane
Ice King@Yeah, I guess there's some cool people here, musics a little loud but the but the punch is top-drawer.@Astral Plane
Lauren@Mm hmm@Astral Plane
Ice King@Hey, you should come to one of my parties sometime; I'm friends with some pretty cool people too you know?@Astral Plane
Lauren@Uh huh, who are your friends?@Astral Plane
Ice King@Oh, uh- like that guy, Finn.@Astral Plane
Lauren@Finn?!@Astral Plane
Ice King@Yeah, Finn and I are pretty tight!@Astral Plane
Lauren@Hmmm@Astral Plane
Cloud Woman 2@Oh, hi, are you the ice-dude?@Astral Plane
Ice King@That's me, ice-dude. . Hey, have you ever seen the inside of an ice bear cave?@Astral Plane
Lauren@Did you say you know Finn the Human?@Astral Plane
Cloud Man 1@Hey, buddy, buddy! Care to freshen me up?!@Astral Plane
Ice King@Yeah, yeah, now scram.@Astral Plane
Lauren@Hey, is Finn seeing anyone right now? Could you introduce us? Oh my glob! Is he here now?!@Astral Plane
Ice King@So I guess you're more into the 'little brother-type'? Huh.@Astral Plane
Cloud Man 2@Hey Lauren, I heard your grandpa's given out ice!@Astral Plane
Ice King@Ice?! I'll give you ice! Oh, looks like I put this party- on ice. Oh wait, you want ice? You, oh, you got iced! Anyway, oh, don't look at me like that Lauren. . Eh, this party was weak anyway.@Astral Plane
Finn@Poor Simon. Poor Simon, I guess? Poor Simon... sort-of? It's like some part of him wants to be a sad wong-lord. But why would anyone want that? Is there some... incentive?@Astral Plane
Finn@Sheesh, I wonder if being a sad loner gives you more raw material to form song ideas. Is that where creativity comes from? From sad-biz? I am so high up now. I am so high up, there is no "high up". It's all just... Whoa! What the--? Whoooa! Space Lards! Ah man, Jake would be flipping out; trying to get that super-rare milk. Make a sick flan with that milk. Oh, well.@Astral Plane
Finn@Whoa! What's going on? You can't see me, right?@Astral Plane
Finn@I'm in the Mother Lard! . What? Space birth! Okay, here we go! Whoa! Bye, guys. Oh, that was creative and it wasn't sad either so maybe birth is the greatest statement in all the universe. Hey, baby, ya' gonna give me a boost? . Here comes Mars. What the heck is going on though? Everybody's leaving!@Astral Plane
Grob Gob Glob Grod@Fire defense missiles!@Astral Plane
Star Man@Missiles away! Impact with Catalyst Comet in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!@Astral Plane
Grob Gob Glob Grod@Yes! Do you think it worked, Star Man?@Astral Plane
Star Man@Uh, yeah, probably, right? Shoot! No effect! It's still coming right at us!@Astral Plane
Grob Gob Glob Grod@Was that all of our missiles?@Astral Plane
Star Man@Uh, yeah, I'm surprised we even had those ones. Like who would we shoot a missile at? Who'd we shoot at?!@Astral Plane
Grob Gob Glob Grod@I'm thinking, Star Man!@Astral Plane
Star Man@Rooot!@Astral Plane
Grob Gob Glob Grod@Grob. Assessment.@Astral Plane
Grob Gob Glob Grod@We're sunk, bro. This whole place is gonna be a stinkin' molten dump in a minute.@Astral Plane
Grob Gob Glob Grod@It doesn't make sense. Every 1,000 years, the Catalyst Comet mysteriously reincarnates itself and collides with Earth, bringing with it an agent of change. But the comet has never been so off schedule - and it's never freakin' hit Mars!@Astral Plane
Grob Gob Glob Grod@What do you think, Finn the Human?@Astral Plane
Finn@Wha? Who, me? You can see me too?@Astral Plane
Grob Gob Glob Grod@Yes, I am Glob.@Astral Plane
Finn@Oh yeah. Hey, do you ever say "Oh my Glob?"@Astral Plane
Grob Gob Glob Grod@No, but sometimes Gob does. You're dreaming so far from home, it must be comet related.@Astral Plane
Finn@Yeah, but, I gotta question.@Astral Plane
Grob Gob Glob Grod@What's that?@Astral Plane
Finn@Well, if just being born is the greatest act of creation. Then what are you suppose to do after that? Isn't everything that comes next just sort of a disappointment? Slowly entropy-ing until we deflate into a pile of mush?@Astral Plane
Grob Gob Glob Grod@Well, it’s not enough to have created something amazing, right? What if I just let my Martian supersociety go to butt?@Astral Plane
Finn@But what's it worth if we're all gonna get blowed up right now?@Astral Plane
Star Man@Whoa! What are you doing?!@Astral Plane
Finn@Ahhh! Oh my bod!@Astral Plane
Jake@What is it, boyi?!@Astral Plane
Finn@...Glob is dead.@Astral Plane
Evacuation Man@Hello, Star Man, this is Evacuation Man, what's the sitch, can we go back yet?@Astral Plane
Star Man@Yes! Gob Glob Grod Grob diverted the comet, it's back on its normal path to Earth.@Astral Plane
Evacuation Man@And what about the G-Man?@Astral Plane
Star Man@No sign of Glob.@Astral Plane
Martin@Ahh! Computer! What did we hit?! Oh, blobs... oh, for real blobs...@Astral Plane
Finn@Hey, I think Bounce House Princess needs our help.@Astral Plane
Jake@Let's do it!@Astral Plane
Tree Trunks@Hold on, Sweet Pig Trunks. We're coming.@Gold Stars
Tree Trunks@There, there, Sweet P, it was just a dream.@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Just a dream.@Gold Stars
Mr. Pig@That's my brave little boy. Now you better get dressed; today's your first day of school!@Gold Stars

Mr. Pig@That's fuel you're gonna need later to soak up allll the education!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Yesh, dahd!@Gold Stars
Tree Trunks@Okay, there's your lunch and an apple for the teacher. @Gold Stars
Tree Trunks@Golly, it's awful nice of y'all to take Sweet P to school on his first day.@Gold Stars
Finn@Our pleas', T.T.!@Gold Stars
Jake@Yeah, first day of school can be real tough. We wouldn't want Sweet P freaking out or awakening any latent evil spirits within himself!@Gold Stars
Mr. Pig@Well, we're gonna miss you, son.@Gold Stars
Jake@You think he's still secretly evil, that he's still all "Lich-y" in there?@Gold Stars
Finn@Mm, not sure.@Gold Stars
Jake@I don't know, Finn, he just seems so... sweet!@Gold Stars
Finn@Mm.@Gold Stars
Mr. Pig & Tree Trunks@Bye!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Bye!@Gold Stars
Jake@So far so good.@Gold Stars
Finn@Fat squirrel in trub! Gah! Oh, no!@Gold Stars
Jake@Wait, Finn. Let's just see how this plays out.@Gold Stars
Jake@Daww!@Gold Stars
Finn@Hmm...@Gold Stars
Finn@Alright, welp, see you later, Sweet P!@Gold Stars
Jake@Bye.@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Bye, Teddy-Man.@Gold Stars
Kid 1@Hey, Baby-Man! Did your grandma knit your clothes?@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Yeah, and she's my mom!@Gold Stars
Kid 1@Why are you laughing, Baby-Man? You're not even a real kid!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Huh?!@Gold Stars
Kid 1@You're nothing but a big, weird baby-man! Baby-Man!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Let's see what we got here. Hello there. Intimidated by those bullies, eh?@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Uh, yeah.@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@What's your name, kid?@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Sweet P!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@I'm the one true King of Ooo. This is my attorney, Toronto. Sweet P, there are all kinds of education, you know.@Gold Stars
Sweet P@No?@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Yes, sir, all kinds! Such as... dancing. You could blow off this podunk school and get a proper dance education! Then you can come back and really show those mean kids and make your parents proud!@Gold Stars
Toronto@Hey, King of Ooo!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Yes, Toronto?@Gold Stars
Toronto@You are a certified dance instructor, right? Show the kid the dance you do.@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Nooo, that dance is too tough for an amateur!@Gold Stars
Toronto@Aw, come on. You gotta show the kid. It's awesome!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Yeah, I know it's awesome, but I really don't think the kid is ready.@Gold Stars
Toronto@Ready?@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@I don't think he's tough enough to be ready.@Gold Stars
Sweet P@I'm tough enough to be ready!@Gold Stars
Toronto@See?! The kid is tough... and ready!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Please?!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Aah, I do see it!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Eee!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@You've got a good eye, and you're a good dog! Watch this, kid.@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Ahh!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Well, we got us a prodigy here. You're ready for advanced classes. Hey, you mugs, wanna see some world-class dancing? Just turn around!@Gold Stars
Candy Person 1@Ah, leave me alone!@Gold Stars
Candy Person 2@Leave me alone, too.@Gold Stars
Candy Person 3@I'm turning around!@Gold Stars
Toronto@Teeth!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Ha, ya did great!@Gold Stars
Toronto@You should come back tomorrow, kid, for more dancin' lessons!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Have a gold star! Show that to your parents, kid. They'll love it! But... don't tell 'em where you got it, or you'll ruin the surprise. Just think how proud they'll be at your big, uhh, end-of-the-year recital! You understand?@Gold Stars
Toronto@Of course Sweet P understands; he's a good boy!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@A good boy!@Gold Stars
Mr. Pig@So, how was school?@Gold Stars
Tree Trunks@Yes, how'd ya do? A gold star?!@Gold Stars
Mr. Pig@I'm gonna put this where we can see it every day. Thumbs up!@Gold Stars
Tree Trunks@Thumbs up! Come on, thumbs up!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Thumbs up!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Thumbs up!@Gold Stars
Toronto@Thumbs up!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Well, this is our place.@Gold Stars
Toronto@We'd invite you in, but the place is a mess.@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@He's right; we're filthy. Listen, we all need a break. Go on home, kid, and we'll see you tomorrow!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Mm!@Gold Stars
Tree Trunks@Sweet P, uh, we're going on a date. You're smart and educated enough to stay at home all by yourself.@Gold Stars
Mr. Pig@The proof is on the fridge!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Mama and Papa will be so surprised if the refrigerator is all covered with stars when they get back. One more star should do it. I need to find King of Ooo and Toronto to get me that last star.@Gold Stars
Toronto@I don't know, K.O, they've gone rancid.@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Horse feathers! A lick of gold paint is all it needs! Just a couple more garbage stars, eh, Toronto?@Gold Stars
Toronto@Mo' stars means mo' dosh!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Soon we'll have enough scratch to fund my big comeback! This kid is great at helping us rob people!@Gold Stars
Toronto@And best of all, he doesn't know a thing! Because if he did...@Gold Stars
King of Ooo & Toronto@We'd have to take care of him!@Gold Stars
Toronto@What was that?!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Sweet P? What did you hear?@Gold Stars
Toronto@What does it matter?! None of it was good!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@We gotta take care of him.@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Aaa!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@I shouldn't have said that out loud.@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Mom, Dad!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Hey, kid! Toronto and I talked it over, and we decided that we're not going to "Take care of you."@Gold Stars
Toronto@We're going to burn down your orchard!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Nooo!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Yup, we're gonna burn it down—unless...@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Unless?@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@You leave home and your loving parents and come dance with us forever.@Gold Stars
Toronto@Forever!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@No! No, no, no, no, no!@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Come on, Sweet P. The people love you!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@They do?@Gold Stars
King of Ooo@Well, mostly they love to laugh at you. I mean, look at yourself. You're a— a— a big, weird baby-man!@Gold Stars
Toronto@Baby-Man, Baby-Man@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Stop.@Gold Stars
Lich/Sweet P@I have learned much from you. Thank you, my teachers. And now for your... education.@Gold Stars
Lich@Before there was time, before there was anything, there was nothing, and before there was nothing... there were monsters. Here's your gold star!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Mr. King of Ooo?@Gold Stars
King of Ooo & Toronto@Monster! Monster! Waaaaah!!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Just a dream!@Gold Stars
Tree Trunks & Mr. Pig@Morning, son - Sweet P!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Surprise!@Gold Stars
Tree Trunks@Oh, my, my, where did you get all this bling?@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Uhh, my teachers!@Gold Stars
Tree Trunks@Wow, how nice of those teachers!@Gold Stars
Sweet P@Mm-hmm!@Gold Stars
Kid 1@Hey, Baby-Man, guess who we are!@Gold Stars
Baby Finn@That's the comet you're supposed to follow.@The Visitor
Finn@Right. Right. I knew that.@The Visitor
Baby Finn@Hey, be careful, okay? Hold on tight.@The Visitor
Finn@It's okay. I won't ever let you go. That's... true.@The Visitor
Finn@Wow. Already? That was fast.@The Visitor
Baby Finn@Yep. We're here. It's time to wake up now.@The Visitor
Finn@What? Now?@The Visitor
Baby Finn@Yep.@The Visitor
Finn@Like, right now?@The Visitor
Baby Finn@Ye—@The Visitor
Finn@Ah. Where am I? What the heck? Is that the comet? And a little farming village? How long have I been walking?@The Visitor
Vulture@Man, two whole days—at least!@The Visitor
Finn@Wow. I need some water.@The Visitor
Vulture@No, wait—ah... jeez.@The Visitor
Finn@Hmm... Fields are lookin' a little sparse. Kinda runty... I wonder if this village even has any wat—oh, snap! I see some!@The Visitor
Finn@Excuse me, sir. Can I have some water? I've been sleepwalking for days.@The Visitor
Finn@Haha, awesome. Haha! Heck yeah! Thanks, little friend! You just totally saved my life. No pun intended. What's the matter? Can't talk? Oh, or are you guys comet boys? From up in there? Listen, I'm no expert, but I think y'all are gonna need a lot more corn. And it's suppose to stand straight up-like. Or maybe comet boys only need just, like, a little bit of limp corn?@The Visitor
The villager@No, I'm a regular guy. I'm not just supposed to talk to strangers.@The Visitor
Mom@Lionel, what'd I tell you about talking to strangers? You get your butt inside this instant!@The Visitor
Tree spirit@HUMAN BOY!@The Visitor
Finn@What the?@The Visitor
Tree spirit@THE TREE SPIRIT DOES NOT PERMIT FREELOADERS! EITHER HELP FETCH THE ESCAPE POD ENGINE OR KINDLY MOVE ALONG!@The Visitor
Finn@Dad?@The Visitor
Tree spirit@Wait, wait! What are you doing? DON'T COME OVER HERE.@The Visitor
Finn@Dad?@The Visitor
Martin@Finn! What the heck are you doing here?@The Visitor
Finn@Dad! What the heck are you doing here?@The Visitor
Finn@What? You were just yelling at me.@The Visitor
Martin@No, no, no, that was the tree spirit—commander of all trees, bringer of hard times.@The Visitor
Finn@Dad.@The Visitor
Martin@You're not falling for it, huh? Well, it was worth a try.@The Visitor
Martin@You know those little guys down there, they'll do anything for the tree spirit. I've got them fetching parts to fix my escape pod, instead of planting their fields. Isn't that sweet?@The Visitor
Finn@Dad, your arm.@The Visitor
Martin@Oh, this? Haha, yeah. When my ship crashed I got shot out of the window. I knocked a kite of the air, then caught my arm in a woodpecker hole.@The Visitor
Finn@Whoa.@The Visitor
Martin@But, it's cool, you know. Arms come and go. It's family that's important. Speaking of arms, though, I see you got yourself a brand spanking new one. How about that!@The Visitor
Finn@Oh. Yeah. I got it from my PB dream sword.@The Visitor
Martin@Uh-huh. Neat.@The Visitor
Finn@Actually, for a while there, I thought if I ever saw you again, I was gonna tear your arm off.@The Visitor
Martin@Well, shoot, who could blame you? Yeah. But you definitely don't feel that way anymore, right?@The Visitor
Finn@No, no, it's okay now.@The Visitor
Martin@Haha! Great! How about a hug?@The Visitor
Finn@What the heck, Dad! Is everything you say a lie?@The Visitor
Martin@No, no, of course not!@The Visitor
Finn@Well, is there any way I can tell the difference?@The Visitor
Martin@Ha ha, I hope not!@The Visitor
Martin@Hot dang! Hold that thought! Those little guys are back with the engine bulb for my pod. 'Scuse me.@The Visitor
Martin@I AM SENDING FORTH MY HOLY EMISSARY, MARTIN MERTENS, AND HIS REGULAR SON, FINN. DON'T FORGET TO DO WHATEVER MARTIN TELLS YOU.@The Visitor
Martin@Almost there. Little further. Aha, little further. Keep it coming. There you go. A li-i-ittle further. A-a-and stop. Fantastic work, boys, absolutely fantastic.@The Visitor
Finn@Holy stonk, Dad! You're messing 'em all up. This is why you are lying to them? So they'll mess themselves up for you?@The Visitor
Martin@What! No, no, no, look! They love it, see? Goochy goochy goo. Goochy goochy! They're helping a poor old stranded man in need. You like to help people, don't ya? I'd do it myself if I could, but I'm too strong to fit through the service hatches. Come on, give me a chance. They're gonna fetch me one last piece, and you and I can watch 'em do it. Then I'll be outta your hair by tomorrow morning.@The Visitor
Finn@Oh. Right.@The Visitor
Martin@Yeah, don't worry. I know I'm cramping your style down here. Am I right? Huh?@The Visitor
Finn@Uh... yeah. Yeah, I-I guess...@The Visitor
Martin@Sure I am! Now let's go fetch that piece.@The Visitor
Finn@It's really warm down here.@The Visitor
Martin@Well, yeah, son. That's just the ship cooking. One thing about this ship, it cooks!@The Visitor
Finn@Should it be cooking?@The Visitor
Martin@Nah, but that's just real life. Okay, babies! I need this piece. It's a steering wheel. It's in the steering room. Last one in breaks tree spirit's heart!@The Visitor
Finn@Wait, wait, wai-wai-wait! You don't have to go in there if you don't want to!@The Visitor
Villager with eyepatch@Nah, I think we want to.@The Visitor
Martin@Okay, I know, I know. Listen, that's the last piece of pod, right? Well, I promise I'll make it up to little boogers tonight. Haha, come here!@The Visitor
Martin@Live it up, pals! This is your night. Hey, hey, careful with the finish. That buggy is ready to blast! Yo, party animals! Still hungry?@The Visitor
One of the villagers@Mmm.@The Visitor
Martin@Come on, tree spirit says! Scoop it till you poop it. Let's get grrro-o-oss!@The Visitor
The villager@Finn?@The Visitor
Finn@Oh, sorry. So you guys wanna learn another one? Ok, watch this. Heh, cute. Uh, hey! So, you guys really believe in the tree spirit?@The Visitor
Villager@Eh, not really, I guess. We're kind of just looking to help out.@The Visitor
Finn@Hmm.@The Visitor
Martin@Hey! It's Finn with the grin! Mind if I sit down? Haha! Look at this! You ever see someone sit like this?@The Visitor
Finn@I guess not. Hey, Martin?@The Visitor
Martin@Yeah.@The Visitor
Finn@Uh, I think I really need some answers to stuff—like where did I come from or who's my mom?@The Visitor
Martin@Haha! Whoops. Okay, uh, long story short—you were born on a... boat... I guess. Like a... banana boat.@The Visitor
Martin@In the middle of the ocean. So... all kinds of stuff tried to eat you— whales and fish... squids... uh, there was a tiger... and... seaweeds. The sea's weeds.@The Visitor
Martin@Your mom was... okay? I don't know. Talking about it stresses me out. Maybe later.@The Visitor
Martin@So one day, I got called on a dangerous mission— no, like a dangerous life choice, two roads diverging in the night and all that.@The Visitor
Martin@And I couldn't bring you along. I always planned to come back for you, but I didn't. That's... true. The end! Look out!@The Visitor
Villager@Everything is ruined. Everyone is fat.@The Visitor
Finn@Aah! Martin!@The Visitor
Martin@Again? Oh, good morning, sweetie!@The Visitor
Finn@Martin, are you leaving?!@The Visitor
Martin@I absolutely gotta, kid. I got pressures on me, stuff you wouldn't understand.@The Visitor
Finn@But what about the villagers?! That ship looks like it's gonna blow up!@The Visitor
Martin@Uh... maybe. I don't know. Maybe it won't blow up. I've seen 100 things weirder than a ship not blowing up.@The Visitor
Finn@Oh, Dad! I need to go shut it off!@The Visitor
Martin@Okay, okay, wait! Wait. If you're gonna turn it off, you gotta pull the heat dump toggle in the engine core. It was too snug for me to get to, and those little guys aren't strong enough. Hmm. Hey, I could wait for you. Maybe we could go into space together.@The Visitor
Finn@Why didn't you tell me about the heat dump in the first place?!@The Visitor
Martin@I don't know... Wink!@The Visitor
Finn@Daaaaah!@The Visitor
Martin@What the—@The Visitor
Finn@Heat dump! Too... stuck!@The Visitor
Villager@Ohhhh, no. This is new to me. Mm...@The Visitor
Finn@Man, you know what's weird? That wasn't even a comet that crashed back there. So, then, what was that dream about? I don't get my brain. Okay, when we get back to the tree house, let me do the talking.@The Visitor

Jake@Okay. Let's watch some stars.@The Mountain
Finn@Hmm. You missed it. It was honestly a little disappointing@The Mountain
Jake@Oh. Okay. Hey, man, I think I hear something weird over there with my little doggy ears.@The Mountain
Flame Princess@Phew! You are killing, Cinnamon Bun! This routine is locked up!@The Mountain
Cinnamon Bun@Oh! Thank you, Princess. You are also killing.@The Mountain
Finn@You mean Flame Princess?@The Mountain
Jake@Naw, man. What I heard didn't sound like her. Give me a peek on there. This is pretty much just a tube. Huh. It's Lemongrab.@The Mountain
Finn@Uh, Lemongrab?! What's he up to at this time of night?@The Mountain
Jake@Uh... it looks like he's headed for the Mountain of Matthew. I hear beaucoup spookoo legends about that place.@The Mountain
Finn@Beaucoup spookoo, you say? We should follow him.@The Mountain
Jake@Huh? How come you care where Lemongrab goes?@The Mountain
Finn@He could, you know, he could be messing with crazy mystic power at that mountain. It's like seeing a baby playing with dynamite. Plus, seeing Flame Princess kind of messed me up. Now I gotta distract myself with work.@The Mountain
Jake@Okay, okay. I feel you. Let's do some things.@The Mountain
Finn@There's his Lemon Camel. Lemongrease must be inside already.@The Mountain

Marceline@Man, this biz takes me back. I used to drink this stuff all the time when I was a kid.@Dark Purple
Finn@What? That's not right. How could the exact same soda still be in production hundreds of years after the great Mushroom Wars?@Dark Purple
Jake@Okay, listen. So, okay, we could go track down the mysterious source of Super Porp. Do up a fuh-real, end up fightin' some big soda-computer-god-baby or whatever... We totally could. But... Super Porp is good. So why question this good thing, man? Why?@Dark Purple

B.P.@Dear diary. Wow. I sound like a real cornball. Oh, well. Dear diary! Mom is going to love you. She's always ragging about me spending too much time with my nose in books. I wonder what I'm going to write in you. What kind of person will I be when I get to your last page? Will I have my braces off? Will I have written a song that doesn't totally suck? Will I have met a cool guy? I can barely look at dudes without breaking out into hives. Just another day in teenage purgatory, AKA the school caf. Sloppy joes again. Boys I did not talk to today—Brownieguy... are they trying to kill us? Stayed in and tried to cut my bangs... Ruffles, Brian, Pennycandy guy... Mom says it looks like I got in a fight with a snapping turtle. Taffi and Mochi are the coolest girls at school. When I think about them, my skin feels sparkly. They don't even know I exist. Why would they? I'm a nobody. Less than nobody. I'm a pimple on the butt of a—@The Diary

Mother, I'm not going to tell you again... Diary, it's my birthday tomorrow, but I don't feel like celebrating. I feel like screaming. Justin wants to meet at Lovetree Point.

Finn@And when that salsa cloud had you by the tail...?@Walnuts and Rain
Jake@Ha ha, yeah. And I swung him around into that golden cactus?@Walnuts and Rain
Finn@Man, that was algebraic.@Walnuts and Rain
Jake@Yeah, man, that adventure was tight.@Walnuts and Rain
Finn@Yeah.@Walnuts and Rain
Jake@I can't wait to get back home, though.@Walnuts and Rain
Finn@Yeah, me, too!@Walnuts and Rain
Jake@I need some sleep—@Walnuts and Rain
Finn@I'm gonna play some Battle Wars with Neptr on BMO for an hour, then work on that flier for PB's laser recital and catch up on my correspondence with my pen pal Danny Gladiolas from over in Maryville.@Walnuts and Rain
Jake@Great minds.@Walnuts and Rain
Finn@And then next what I'm gonna do is I'm— whoop!@Walnuts and Rain
Jake@Finn? Finn! Ohh! Oh...@Walnuts and Rain
Finn@What the...?@Walnuts and Rain
Finn@Man, where's this supposed to be?@Walnuts and Rain
Finn@Uh, excuse me? Sir?@Walnuts and Rain
Huge King@Hmm? Oh! You're awake! Oh, that's wonderful!@Walnuts and Rain
Finn@Oh, thanks. Hey, where am I, anyway?@Walnuts and Rain
Huge King@Why, this is the famed Kingdom of Huge, of course. Heh. You fell through that crack in my ceiling and landed in a normal-sized pie.@Walnuts and Rain
Finn@Mm-hmm. Well, my friend up top is probs pretty worried about me, so I'd best get going. Can you give me a boost back up to that crack or whatever?@Walnuts and Rain
Huge King@Oh-ho-ho! No, no, no. Don't be silly, child. Your friend must be on his way to find you right now. You should wait for him here, or you could miss each other.@Walnuts and Rain
Finn@Hmm. I guess that does make sense.@Walnuts and Rain
Huge King@Of course! Besides, you're just in time to witness the chiming of my wondrous clock! It's set to do its chiming in merely an hour's time!@Walnuts and Rain
Finn@"Krimber"?@Walnuts and Rain
Huge King@Come! Food boys! Shower our guest with the kindnesses of Huge! We will await the clock's chiming in style and comfort.@Walnuts and Rain

Huge King@Just wait till you see my clock!@Walnuts and Rain
Bear@Ahh, good, you're awake. Good good good good good. How you feelin'?@Walnuts and Rain
Jake@Ohh... my cabbage aches a little... What happened?@Walnuts and Rain
Bear@Well, here I was, playin' some Freecell, and then, wow! You fell down the hole. Bounced off parachute #2, an' landed on three ol' walnuts.@Walnuts and Rain
Jake@Parachute? Hole? Walnuts? Fell down, wait! You mean we're fallin' right now? Thanks for your help, buddy, but I gotta go.@Walnuts and Rain
Bear@Woah, hold up! What's your hurry?@Walnuts and Rain
Jake@My friend's still up top. He could be lookin' for me. Or, he could be in trouble and every second I'm down here I'm fallin' further away. I gotta get back.@Walnuts and Rain
Bear@Uhhh, I think that's a pretty bad idea. You were unconscious while you were fallin', remember? So you mighta been fallin' for weeks, or even, months. Trust me, it's possible. This is a very deep hole. If you try to climb out, you could run out of food.@Walnuts and Rain
Jake@But, I gotta do somethin'!@Walnuts and Rain
Bear@I feel like you should prob'ly not starve to death, so that when your friend comes lookin', you're still alive.@Walnuts and Rain
Jake@Mmm. You know I think you're right! Finn is a pretty heroic kid, I gotta admit. He'll pro'ly be here in half a gif.@Walnuts and Rain
Bear@Oh, good. Well 'til then, please, make yourself at home. Here, have a walnut.@Walnuts and Rain
Jake@Thanks, man. I'm Jake, by the way.@Walnuts and Rain
Seven@Hi, Jake. I'm seven-seven-one-eight. Strange name, I know, but I'm pretty sure. See, I carved it in the floor when I first got down here so I wouldn't forget. But you can call me Seven for short.@Walnuts and Rain

Cosmic Owl@Ha ha ha, we can go right now. Is that what this is about?@Hoots
Bird Woman@Yes, let's go right now.@Hoots

Bird Woman@It doesn't have to be over, we can run away, together!@Hoots
Cosmic Owl@Your dreamin' kid, and it's time to wake up.@Hoots

Penguins@Wenk!@Hoots
Gunter@Wenk!@Hoots
Ice King@Huh? What's heatin' him?@Hoots
LSP@Ugh. Reduced to marking my camp with bear sweat. Those bears did not want to give up that sweat, but it keeps the rodents from nibbling my lumps while I sleep. Ouch! I feel something crunchy! Like fried chicken! Oh, it is fried chicken!@Be Sweet
LSP@Oh, my Glob—forest creature! I'd better eat it real fast!@Be Sweet
LSP@Get back here! Aah! What my life has become!@Be Sweet
LSP@Hello? Oh, my Glob!@Be Sweet
Tree Trunks@Oh, wonderful! Welcome in, LSP. Uh, I want to go through—@Be Sweet
LSP@This place is so clean and nice!@Be Sweet
Tree Trunks@You're so kind.@Be Sweet

Tree Trunks@I need to tell you all the s—@Be Sweet
LSP@Get me a towel!@Be Sweet
LSP@Help me down!@Be Sweet
Tree Trunks@O-okay, I-I really do need to tell you how to care for Sweet P. Uh, there's a proper procedure for Sweet P's special tuck-in time. You have to be real sweet to him. Pat him gently on the head, kiss his cheeks...@Be Sweet
LSP@What?@Be Sweet
Tree Trunks@...And give him treats. Sing to him real, real soft and sweet and touch your forehead to his and think the words, "You are more precious than anything in this world, and I will always, always love you." Then he'll fall asleep and have sweet dreams.@Be Sweet
LSP@Oh, my Glob, I'll do all that! Okay, bye! Have a wonderful time! Time to get down to the chill-out!@Be Sweet
LSP@What a princess like me deserves. Aah! Don't hurt me!@Be Sweet
Sweet P@I'm Sweet P.@Be Sweet
LSP@I didn't know you were huge.@Be Sweet
Sweet P@I'm hungry.@Be Sweet
LSP@Okay, let's check what's in the fridge. Do you like pizza?@Be Sweet
Sweet P@I like pizza.@Be Sweet
LSP@Get the pizza, Sweet P!@Be Sweet
LSP@Now I can kick back. Refrigerators are just great! I never stopped to think how great they are. Now I'm cold, though. Oh, what?! I'm still cold. Rich-person indoor fire is just so great. I'm feeling all toasty! Must be time for toast! I'm waiting... Waiting... Waiting... All done! It's not black and crunchy like when I throw bread into my campfire.@Be Sweet
LSP@This music's way better than owls' hoots.@Be Sweet
LSP@I deserve this.@Be Sweet
LSP@No! You're an animal! You can't come inside!@Be Sweet
Sweet P@I'm ready to be tucked in now. Hello? Will you be sweet to me?@Be Sweet
Sweet P@Sweetness must be out there in the night to guide my sleepy boat right.@Be Sweet
Marceline@Yo!@Be Sweet
LSP@Hey, Marcy!@Be Sweet
Marceline@LSPita bread, what's up?@Be Sweet
LSP@Just chillin' in my awesome bubble bath!@Be Sweet
Marceline@Did you break into someone's house again?@Be Sweet
LSP@Ugh! I have a new life now and a career.@Be Sweet
Marceline@I didn't know you had any skills.@Be Sweet
LSP@Success isn't about skills. It's about being cool. These people just randomly approached me, like, "Hey, we will totally pay you to hang out in our sick mansion and feed our baby" or whatever.@Be Sweet
Marceline@Well, good for you, dude.@Be Sweet
LSP@I mean, I feel like a totally new person now that I'm finally getting what I deserve.@Be Sweet
LSP@Oh, my Glob, what is that?!@Be Sweet
LSP@Aah!@Be Sweet
Marceline@LSP? Mm.@Be Sweet
LSP@Take this, you dandruff!@Be Sweet

Raccoon@Look what you've done, LSP.@Be Sweet
LSP@Huh?@Be Sweet
Raccoon@You made it gross. Everything you touch turns gross!@Be Sweet
LSP@Uh...@Be Sweet
Raccoon@Just like you!@Be Sweet
LSP@Aah!@Be Sweet
Raccoon@You don't really think you deserved any of this, do you? You're a rat, just a giant rat that wandered into somebody's nice house.@Be Sweet
LSP@I'm a good person! I take care of babies! Look! Baby Sweet P? Baby Sweet P! Oh, my Glob, I lost the baby! I lost the baby! I'm a bad person!@Be Sweet
Raccoon@Just accept that you're garbage!@Be Sweet
LSP@Hi-yah! Baby Sweet P!@Be Sweet
LSP@Have you seen a big, fat child around here?! Have you seen my enormous baby?! If only I'd cooked the pizza!@Be Sweet
LSP@I could've eaten some, too! I'm so stupid! You got to help me! I lost some old couple's baby 'cause I didn't do the sweet things! I just wanted a bubble bath, and... How did I lose something so bi-i-i-i-g?!@Be Sweet
Banana Guard@Ma'am, you're gonna have to come with us.@Be Sweet
LSP@Baby Sweet P! Give me that donut!@Be Sweet
Banana Guard@No!@Be Sweet
LSP@I'm not a bad person! I'm not a bad person!@Be Sweet
LSP@Huh?@Be Sweet
Banana Guard@Hey, big baby!@Be Sweet
LSP@I found you!@Be Sweet
Sweet P@LSP!@Be Sweet
LSP@Sweet P! I'm so sorry! I should've been sweet to you! Here, okay, um... Pat very gently on the head... Kiss on both cheeks... Mwah! Mwah! Treat.@Be Sweet
Sweet P@Mmm!@Be Sweet
LSP@Uh, and sing something sweet. ♪ Butter cakes, cupcakes, and ice cream cakes small baby bums and the friendship of puppies ♪ You are more precious than anything in this world, and I will always, always love you.@Be Sweet
LSP@Aww!@Be Sweet
Tree Trunks@We're ho-o-me!@Be Sweet
LSP@Shh! He's asleep.@Be Sweet
Tree Trunks@Why is Sweet P's blanket on the wall—?@Be Sweet
LSP@Shh! Mr. and Mrs. Pig Trunks, I have some good news. Sweet P has grown so attached to me that it would be cruel for me to leave him, obviously. So... Yes, I will accept the position as your live-in nanny!@Be Sweet
LSP@Huh?@Be Sweet
Raccoon@Partake of the chicken.@Be Sweet
LSP@Chicken...@Be Sweet
LSP@This is good chicken!@Be Sweet
Tree Trunks@Maybe we can get, uh, Neptr to sit. I don't know.@Be Sweet
Sweet P@Mama? I had that dream again—the one where I'm a comet boy.@Be Sweet
Tree Trunks@Oh, really?@Be Sweet
Sweet P@Yeah, coming back to Ooo over and over, and there was a fake comet, a beard man in a spaceship.@Be Sweet
Tree Trunks@My, what an imagination...@Be Sweet

Candy Person@Whoopee!@Hot Diggity Doom
King of Ooo@Thank you, little candies. Thank you. You warm the wax heart of this poor king of Ooo! Now, I hear you asking, "King of Ooo, how can you be so wise?" I'll tell you how. Did you know that I am 8000 years old? Could be.@Hot Diggity Doom
King of Ooo@It's true. I'm that wonderful.@Hot Diggity Doom
King of Ooo@Now, Princess Bubblegum — she says she hasn't gone rogue. She says she's not a wild dog thirsty for blood. She says she's not a literal baby masquerading as an adult woman. She says a lot of things. Princess Bubblegum, you don't make sense!@Hot Diggity Doom
Jake@This guy's really working on me.@Hot Diggity Doom
Finn@Ennnh...@Hot Diggity Doom
King of Ooo@Yes, dear? Do you have something to say?@Hot Diggity Doom
Mrs. James@Mm-hmm. I'm James' mother, Mrs. James. My son got turned into a mutant mass and was exiled to the badlands by Princess Bubblegum.@Hot Diggity Doom
Princess Bubblegum@Trehh! Boo.@Hot Diggity Doom
King of Ooo@Who isn't mad about their mutant children?@Hot Diggity Doom
Candy dude@What about Sweet P, King of Ooo? You threatened to burn down his mama's orchard.@Hot Diggity Doom
King of Ooo@I did. That is true. Sweet P, I was like a cornered animal. "I knew no' what thy doone." I'm sorry, Sweet P. Here. Psst — give me a kiss.@Hot Diggity Doom
King of Ooo@Do you hear us, Princess Bubblegum? Do you hear us?!@Hot Diggity Doom
Princess Bubblegum@Shhhhhhhhut up.@Hot Diggity Doom
Peppermint Butler@Princess, I'm sorry to disturb you, but I feel that you must campaign. The candy people are real dumb.@Hot Diggity Doom
Princess Bubblegum@I'm studying something that could be real important. Dah! This dumb election. It's not even — I mean, it's barely even — ...barely even legal.@Hot Diggity Doom
King of Ooo@A barely and yet fully legal election — that's what my campaign manager told me. Let's hear it for him — Mr. X! Weird, right?@Hot Diggity Doom
Princess Bubblegum@And even being legal, I mean, I made everyone. I made their homes. The candy people are mercurial, but they're not dillweeds.@Hot Diggity Doom
King of Ooo@And this definitely legal election is in the jam-covered fingers of you, the people — the candies. So, go. Vote with your hearts. Vote with your minds. Vote for the candidate who's not a teenage gum-golem.@Hot Diggity Doom
Princess Bubblegum@I mean, they know that I love them.@Hot Diggity Doom
Starchy@And the votes are in. King of Ooo is our new princess.@Hot Diggity Doom
King of Ooo@Hey, hey!@Hot Diggity Doom
Princess Bubblegum@What?!@Hot Diggity Doom
Princess Bubblegum@Whaaaaat?! You dillweeds! You're a dillweed, you're a dillweed's secretary, and you're probably some dillweed I've never met! You're three dillweeds being dillweeds, and you're going to dillweed this place into the ground! And you —@Hot Diggity Doom
Finn@Princess! Princess! I don't know what a dillweed is.@Hot Diggity Doom
Jake@Hey, PB, what's the plan? We pledged our allegiance to you.@Hot Diggity Doom
Princess Bubblegum@Your allegiance is to the kingdom. Dudes, I don't know. I don't know when I'll be back in charge — if I'll be back in charge. I need you both to stick around here and make sure the candy people are safe, even if it means working for a wad. Auf wiedersehen, meine champions. Mwah. Mwah.@Hot Diggity Doom
King of Ooo@There's a new golden and waxy mornin'. Good times a-comin'. You've got your warning. There's cheap healthcare, the workcamp's there. The general tone is laissez-faire. I'm a princess, I'm a princess. I'm a priiiinceeeess.@Hot Diggity Doom
Princess Bubblegum@What's up, Peps?@Hot Diggity Doom
Peppermint Butler@It's stuck.@Hot Diggity Doom
Princess Bubblegum@Ho, no, no, no, no! It's okay, everyone. It's okay. Close your eyes and repeat your safety mantra — hoodie hoodie hoodup, hoodie hoodie hoodup, hoodie —@Hot Diggity Doom
Peppermint Butler@Princess?@Hot Diggity Doom
Princess Bubblegum@Huh? Oh. Sorry, peps. I'm just so used to having my citizens around to protect. This is gonna take some getting used to.@Hot Diggity Doom
Peppermint Butler@Permission to speak freely, ma'am?@Hot Diggity Doom
Princess Bubblegum@Granted.@Hot Diggity Doom
Peppermint Butler@This horrible dump does not meet the level of fancy to which I have become accustomed.@Hot Diggity Doom
Princess Bubblegum@Noted. Also, FYI — my Uncle Gumbald built this cabin with his bare hands. I spent my summers here when I was younger. Anyway, it'll probably take a really long time for the candy people to realize a bad ruler is worse than a good ruler. Plenty of time to spruce this place up.@Hot Diggity Doom
Starchy@Whew! Starchy thought life would be better under the King of Ooo, but now there's even more stuff to sweep. Poor old Starchy. Always getting the sweaty end of the lollipop.@Hot Diggity Doom
Finn@Hey, Starchy. What are you doing — sweeping?@Hot Diggity Doom
Starchy@Oh, uh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Suh-wee-ee-eepin'. Yeah.@Hot Diggity Doom
Jake@Mm. Hey, is it me, or is getting purpler out here?@Hot Diggity Doom
Finn@Oh, yeah. I think that's the catalyst comet. Guess it's getting pretty close or whatever.@Hot Diggity Doom
Jake@Getting close? Should we evacuate or...@Hot Diggity Doom
Finn@What? No, no. It's cool, I think. It's just here to, like, shake things up, you know?It's okay. We've got sort of a — a relationship.@Hot Diggity Doom
Starchy@C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-comet?! Oh, Starchy don't feel good about this.@Hot Diggity Doom
Jake@Starch?@Hot Diggity Doom
Finn@Eht.@Hot Diggity Doom
Starchy@Oh, Mrs. gumdrop! He's coming. The comet — it's gonna snuff out all life as we know it.@Hot Diggity Doom
Mrs. gumdrop@What?! Oh, good Glob!@Hot Diggity Doom
Jake@Shouldn't we try and calm them down?@Hot Diggity Doom
Finn@Ehh, not after that whole knock-my-tower-over-onto-the-castle thing. A lot of guys got smooshed. They need to hear it from someone they really trust.@Hot Diggity Doom
Finn@King of Ooo!@Hot Diggity Doom
Jake@King of Ooo!@Hot Diggity Doom
Finn@King of Ooo?@Hot Diggity Doom
Jake@King of Ooo?@Hot Diggity Doom

Finn@What are you saying?@Hot Diggity Doom
Jake@I thought it was "kinkoff goo."@Hot Diggity Doom
Jake@Hey. You hear that?@Hot Diggity Doom
Finn@Downstairs. King of Ooo? King of Ooo?@Hot Diggity Doom
Jake@King of Ooo!@Hot Diggity Doom
Jake@What the —@Hot Diggity Doom
Finn@It's that guy from before. He's mucking around with PB's ship — added all kinds of engines to it.@Hot Diggity Doom
Jake@Hey!@Hot Diggity Doom
Finn@Hey, what do you think you're doing? PB don't let nobody touch her stuff — not even me, and I'm cool — least of all you, you sauce-tasting Brian-sniffer — whoa!@Hot Diggity Doom
Finn@Whoa, whoa, whoa! Yeeh! Yeeh! Whoa! Uhhh! No mercy, Jake.@Hot Diggity Doom
Jake@Aaaaah!@Hot Diggity Doom

Starchy@Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Oww!@Hot Diggity Doom
King of Ooo@Aaaaah!@Hot Diggity Doom
King of Ooo@Toronto, I've been princess for four hours, and society has already totally collapsed. Plus, now the sky is falling, I guess. Is this possibly... Somehow my fault?@Hot Diggity Doom
Toronto@Pbbt! No way! Okay, look. Without your calming presence and selfless leadership, this situation would have been a hundred times worse. History will remember you as Ooo's greatest hero.@Hot Diggity Doom
King of Ooo@As always, the voice of reason. Once again, my saintly nature has compelled me, unthinking, to assume the burdens of others. But a true justice demands a true accounting. And truly this is all Bubblegum's fa-aa-aa-ault!@Hot Diggity Doom
King of Ooo@Oof! Good glob! What no-o-o-o-o-w?@Hot Diggity Doom
Princess Bubblegum@Looking good, Peps. Man, this feels kind of good, right? It's like we're building a whole new kingdom from scratch, only without all my beloved citizens this time... and their dull, pleading chicken eyes. Maybe the King of Ooo could hold down the fort for a little while. I mean, what's the worst that could happen? Anyway, I'm gonna get some fresh air. B.R.B. What the — why's it so purple outsi—@Hot Diggity Doom
Princess Bubblegum@What the? Why it so purple outsi-@The Comet
Princess Bubblegum@What?!@The Comet
Pep Butler@It's too smoky to see...@The Comet
Pep Butler@Oh! Something's peeking. Someone's jacking your spaceship!@The Comet
Finn@Yeow!@Bonnie & Neddy
Toronto@Whoops.@Bonnie & Neddy
King of Ooo@And I dub thee Sir Jake the Dog.@Bonnie & Neddy
King of Ooo@You two now comprise the royal guard of the one true princess of Ooo. That's me! As such, you may no longer own property or operate children and must render all treasure and wives unto your sworn princess within a hangman's fortnight.@Bonnie & Neddy
Jake@Joke's on you, man. We spent all our treasure the other day. Plus, don't even have any wives.@Bonnie & Neddy
Finn@Wait, what? What about Lady?@Bonnie & Neddy
Jake@Lady's my girlfriend.@Bonnie & Neddy
Finn@Wait, but...@Bonnie & Neddy
Jake@That was Tree Trunks.@Bonnie & Neddy
Finn@Oh, yeah.@Bonnie & Neddy
King of Ooo@We, the inhabitants of Ooo, owe you heroes our very lives. As the once powerful and dignified Princess Bubblegum sulked off into exile, it fell upon you two to save us from the impending comet of doom and/or from the hideous Orgalorg, who aimed to eat the powerful comet and grow invincible! And for that, we are eternally grateful.@Bonnie & Neddy
Toronto@I know I am.@Bonnie & Neddy
King of Ooo@But now your bravery is essential to a new heroic task! Can you guess what it is?@Bonnie & Neddy
Finn@Uh...@Bonnie & Neddy
King of Ooo@Come on. Guess!@Bonnie & Neddy
Finn@Um... Fight a—Fight a dragon?@Bonnie & Neddy
King of Ooo@Wrong! Follow me.@Bonnie & Neddy
Marceline@Knock, knock. Yo, Peebs, you want to make a midnight Squeez-E-Mart run? I'm gonna drink the red from out the customers' bloodshot eyes. Psych. I'll probably just get a slushie.@Varmints
Marceline@Bubblegum? Bonnibel!@Varmints
King of Ooo@Wha—?@Varmints
Marceline@Ugh! What are you doing here?!@Varmints
King of Ooo@Be not afraid, child. It is I, the one true princess of Ooo!@Varmints
Marceline@Where's Bubblegum?!@Varmints
King of Ooo@Whoa! Relax! Bubblegum is fine, just fine... and deposed! And powerless! So crushed by defeat was she that the tyrant exiled herself to a sad cabin on the shores of Lake Butterscotch—technically still Candy Kingdom territory. But in my mercy, I've allowed her to remain.@Varmints
Marceline@You're the princess?! Since when?@Varmints
King of Ooo@Well, by the reckoning of my new Torontian calendar, Ooo's official calendar, uh, two glorious months.@Varmints
Marceline@Two months? But—then why didn't she t— Bubblegum!@Varmints
King of Ooo@Tell Bubblegum I wear her nightgown! Tell everyone!@Varmints
 Marceline@Hey that's my feet@Mama Said
BMO@Football, you don't mean that.@Football (Adventure Time)

BMO@Well, let's switch places for the day.@Football (Adventure Time)
Football@Oh, BMO, you'd do that for me?@Football (Adventure Time)

Marceline@Come on, Marce. It'll only hurt for a second.@Marceline the Vampire Queen
Marceline@That's nothing in the face of eternity.@Marceline the Vampire Queen
Marceline@A second hurts really bad in the face of eternity. But only for a moment.@Marceline the Vampire Queen
Marceline@Wait. I have an even better idea. Sunscreen. SPF 10... million. Hmm! I have exactly enough to reach my umbrella.@Marceline the Vampire Queen
Finn@Marceline, no!@Everything Stays
Marceline@Don't let anyone read my diaries! Burn them, Finn! They're embarrassi—!@Everything Stays
Marceline's mom@And then he said, "Fine." That's the story of how I met your dad.@Everything Stays
Marceline@Can I play now?@Everything Stays
Marceline's mom@No, Marceline, Sweetie. It's nap time.@Everything Stays
Marceline@But I don't want to sleep! My dreams are weird.@Everything Stays
Marceline's mom@All dreams are weird.@Everything Stays
Marceline@But, Mom, my dreams are we-e-e-eird.@Everything Stays
Marceline's mom@Honey, something weird might just be something familiar viewed from a different angle. And that's not scary, right?@Everything Stays
Simon@Hello, Marci. I don't know if you'll ever hear this message. I fear my thoughts are no longer my own. Just watch over me...@Everything Stays
Simon@...until I can find my way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity. And then maybe, Betty, my princess—maybe you will love me again. Please love me again, Betty! Okay, bye!@Everything Stays
Marceline@Hey, Simon. I, uh, finished packing your gear. So can I have my tape now?@Everything Stays
Simon@What? No. This is private, silly. There you go. Snug as a bug.@Everything Stays
Marceline@Seriously, Simon. Please don't go.@Everything Stays
Simon@I... I have to protect you.@Everything Stays
Marceline@How can you protect me if you're not even here?!@Everything Stays
Simon@I'll arrange for someone to come take care of you. I'll make sure he doesn't leave.@Everything Stays
Marceline@Please, Simon, I could help you with this.@Everything Stays
Simon@Yeah, maybe one day you will. But until then, you have to stay brave, my fearless Marceline.@Everything Stays
Marceline@Ouch!@Everything Stays
Simon@You see? I have to go now. Goodbye, Marci.@Everything Stays
Marceline@What? No! Wait! Ugh! Simon! Simon!@Everything Stays
Fool@Hey, this is nuts, right? Look, I've got both my teeth. Look! I lost one in a box turtle once. Also, I used to be dead.@Vamps About
Vampire King@Mwah! Fool, this is life. Get a hot dog if you can't take the bun.@Vamps About
Empress@Pah! It tastes different here. Where are we? It's like we fell asleep on a raft and woke up in strange seas.@Vamps About
Hierophant@Hmph! "Fell asleep"? We died. The demon Marceline staked us all. Why are we back? How did it happen? Listen—I dunno and I don't care. We're alive and I'm going to get eating.@Vamps About
Empress@Ugh.@Vamps About
Fool@Ahhh... Does anyone have any milk for this? Do you, like, carry milk?@Vamps About
Cow@Moo!@Vamps About
Cow@Moo?@Vamps About
Empress@This is well and good for you, Hierophant, all you ever needed was a forest and something hot to chew on.@Vamps About
Empress@Where are the comforts of the old hive? The minions... the blood... the good blood with the gold leaf flaked into it.@Vamps About
Vampire King@The gold leaf was stupid. It didn't taste like anything.@Vamps About
Empress@We had standards! It doesn't matter when we are or where we are, because... we are. We must start rebuilding our realm. There's life here, and I bet it's pathetic.@Vamps About
Empress@We march in, we take control, and we rebuild the hive! My king, are you listening?@Vamps About
Fool@I dunno. Like... What if we just got a loft downtown?@Vamps About
Fool@Whoops, I'm hypnotized. Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh!@Vamps About
Fool@Good old backwards egg!@Vamps About
Cow@Ugh. Ugh! I don't like to dance. I'm a wallflower.@Vamps About
Cow@Oh! Ugh.@Vamps About
Hierophant@My king, surely you agree that this is our chance to go back to our old ways. Surely diverging from the old ways is what made us vulnerable the first time. Surely—@Vamps About
Vampire King@"Surely"?! Surely? Shirley J. Temple! @Vamps About
Hierophant@Oh!@Vamps About
Vampire King@I am your king, and I say it's a new era! Old-fashioned ideas have no place here.@Vamps About
Hierophant@Do what you like! I know what's right.@Vamps About
Empress@If you're going to caterwaul like this, then I may as well start building my army. Hasta luego, turds.@Vamps About
Cow@Oh... gettin' dizzy...@Vamps About
Princess Bubblegum@Mm-hmm. Six and 19...@May I Come In?
Finn@One vampire—, two vampire—. Jake, check me out—I'm a self-sufficient mountain man.@May I Come In?
Jake@No! Don't put that biz in your mouth, man! They could be booby-trapped or poisoned or—@May I Come In?
Marceline@Whoa, chill, Jake. These pearls were dropped by The Moon. Her main power is accelerated healing. It'll be like fighting a cutting board.@May I Come In?
Jake@Hmm. Okay. Anyways, we should try to find her before— No!@May I Come In?
Princess Bubblegum@See, Marcy? Isn't vampire hunting better with friends?@May I Come In?
Marceline@Yeah, I guess. I'm just glad Simon is okay.@May I Come In?
Jake@Anyway... I don't care how easy this vamp's supposed to be. We should hole up somewhere before the sun goes down—It's down. Great.@May I Come In?
Princess Bubblegum@Yup. Let's get going. My vampire thingy is indicating high levels of vampire junk in... this direction. Come on!@May I Come In?
King of Ooo@Ha-ha!@May I Come In?
Crunchy@Stop, please!@May I Come In?
King of Ooo@Don't be such a nerd, Crunchy. Hunting is the most royal of sports. The people expect it of their princess-king.@May I Come In?
Crunchy@I don't think that's tr— Ow! Aah!@May I Come In?
King of Ooo@After him, Haydancy!@May I Come In?
Marceline@Wait, I was hunting a vampire... The Moon.@Take Her Back
Princess Bubblegum@Cut it out! That's not helping her.@Take Her Back
Finn@But Mom and Dad always burped on us.@Take Her Back
Jake@It's a cure-all!@Take Her Back
Princess Bubblegum@Sorry, guys. There are no cure-alls. Your parents were just burping on you for kicks.@Take Her Back
Jake@Oh, yeah, that makes sense. Oh, sorry, last one.@Take Her Back
Princess Bubblegum@Huh! What did you eat, Jake?!@Take Her Back
Jake@Hey, now! I pride myself in having nice-smelling burps. Just kidding.@Take Her Back
Princess Bubblegum@Pride... hmm. Do you guys know what "hubris" is?@Take Her Back
Finn@It's like an old-timey deity who weighed your deeds on a scale.@Take Her Back
Princess Bubblegum@No. It means excessive pride or arrogance.@Take Her Back
Lumpy Space Princess@That's like you, PB.@Take Her Back
Finn@Dude.@Take Her Back
Princess Bubblegum@No, it's true. I believed in myself so much that I was blind to the possible consequences.@Take Her Back
Lumpy Space Princess@Don't believe in yourself so much then, Dum-dum.@Take Her Back
Princess Bubblegum@Now my best friend is dying of poison because of me.@Take Her Back
Jake@That ain't true, PB. Marcy took a risk, and you helped her because you're her friend. Real friends take each other to the edge of death—'cause death is life! Right, Finn?@Take Her Back
Finn@Shoot, yeah! I get poisoned all the time just doing the dishes!@Take Her Back
Peppermint Butler@I get poisoned on purpose, for research. I have a poison lab back at the castle.@Take Her Back
Princess Bubblegum@Well, let's get our butts over there then! Find The Moon, Finn. We'll work on an antidote. You guys take her back to the poison lab. Maybe we can extract her healing powers.@Take Her Back
Finn@Word!@Take Her Back
Lumpy Space Princess@Hey, wait! What should I do? You guys?@Take Her Back
Peppermint Butler@Evil is rising. In vile power, the fiend walks among us again. The Vampire King. With all my investigations into the supernatural, I should know better, but I can't help it. I'm dying to see him in person! I probably will die if I see him in person.@Checkmate
Peppermint Butler@Hello?@Checkmate
Jake@Yo, yo, yo, yo! Bubblegum sent me for the bucket.@Checkmate
Peppermint Butler@Dozo.@Checkmate
Jake@Merci and adios.@Checkmate
Peppermint Butler@Wait! Uh... how's it going?@Checkmate
Jake@It's good, you know? Uh, Marceline's got all her powers back. She's getting ready to give the Vampire King a big, fat whompin', uh, I hope.@Checkmate
Peppermint Butler@Um, while that's going down, do you think you could ask the V.K. to sign something for me?@Checkmate
Jake@That would be weird. You're weird.@Checkmate
Finn@Oh, geez. Oh, geez. Ugh, come on. Uh... Come on. Come on.@The Dark Cloud
Bubblegum@Finn, don't worry about it. We've got bigger fish to fry right now.@The Dark Cloud
Finn@But...@The Dark Cloud
Bubblegum@It's fine. Pep-but used to love being scattered all around. He used to tell me that.@The Dark Cloud
Peppermint Butler's mouth@Lies!@The Dark Cloud
Bubblegum@Those farmers won't keep this thing busy for long. So it's up to the four of us to stop him. Are you ready, Marceline? Marceline? Hey, what's wrong?@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@Me, I guess.@The Dark Cloud
Bubblegum@What?@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@Me. I'm wrong. This—all of this—this is all my fault. Even just fighting the vampires in the first place screwed everything up. Sure screwed me up, anyway. And, geez Louise, trying to fix it—trying to fix me... Just made things a thousand times worse. So why even try, you know? What's the point?@The Dark Cloud
Bubblegum@What? Marceline, no. Come on! We're always the underdogs, you and me, and we always pull through. Like that one time, you remember? The case of the purloined egg?@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@No! I told you, that's it. I'm done.@The Dark Cloud
Cloud Dance@All right people, this is our last stand! It's gonna take every one of us to see this thing through—me, Onion Man, Short Man, Terry— whoa!—Short-Stack, Good-Beard, DeShawn, Seedman, Sandwich Paul, Angry Susan...@The Dark Cloud
Cloud Dance@Muy Linda, Dr. Belstar...@The Dark Cloud
Farmer@Help!@The Dark Cloud
Cloud Dance@...Limbo Man, Quasar, Dogman, Tightwad, Raspberry Sam...@The Dark Cloud
Farmer #2@Up here!@The Dark Cloud
Cloud Dance@...DJ Fresh-Start, and my boy Big Trace.@The Dark Cloud
Finn@You sure you're not coming, Marceline? We could really use your help. Marceline? Okay, maybe later then.@The Dark Cloud
Jake@Come on, Finn! Let me hear that war cry!@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@Well, you finally did it, big guy. You won. Well played. I just kind of wish you would gotten it over with a thousand years ago and saved us all some trouble.@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@Better late than never, I guess.@The Dark Cloud
Ice King@You remembered my song!@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@Simon? W-what are you doing here?@The Dark Cloud
Ice King@Well, I saw through my peeping scope that everything was going boom and exploding and monsters, and all my friends were in grave danger and horrible torment.@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@And you wanted to help?@The Dark Cloud
Ice King@No! I felt left out. I'm just a phone call away, you know.@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@I'm sorry, Simon. Next time, for sure. Anyway, you don't want in on this fight. This one's a loser.@The Dark Cloud
Ice King@Oh, I see. Sittin' this one out, huh?@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@Yeah, I guess. And don't try to talk me out of it.@The Dark Cloud
Ice King@What? No, no, I'm right there with you. You and me—we're survivors, right? Like cockroaches or rats. Sure, you could fight and try to save the day, but what if you lose? Then what? You could die. Better to rot and hide like a rat, right, buddy?@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@Ugh! Did you just call me a cockroach, Simon?!@The Dark Cloud
Ice King@What? No! No, no, no, no.@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@Thanks, buddy.@The Dark Cloud
Ice King@Yes.@The Dark Cloud
King of Ooo@Ahh, this is nice. Getting a little warm for royal fineries, though. Mm-hmm!@The Dark Cloud
Crunchy@Princess? It sounds pretty bad out there. Perhaps you should protect your people.@The Dark Cloud
King of Ooo@Yeesh, it does sound bad! Hey, banana men, listen to your princess! In my kingdom, we look after our own—me! You look after me! Close the gates!@The Dark Cloud
Banana Guard@S-she's beautiful.@The Dark Cloud
Banana Guard #2@You're preachin' to the preacher, brother.@The Dark Cloud
King of Ooo@I'm beautiful! Close the gate!@The Dark Cloud
Banana Guard@No. You're not beautiful. We see you clearly now. You're earwax!@The Dark Cloud
Banana Guard@You're earwax!@The Dark Cloud
King of Ooo@Aah! Huh?!@The Dark Cloud
Crunchy@And the power returns to Crunchy!@The Dark Cloud
King of Ooo@Aah!@The Dark Cloud
King of Ooo@But you love m-e-e-e-e!@The Dark Cloud
Crunchy@And instead of a wax idol, they shall have a true princess... Wrought of iron, with teeth of diamonds. Her heart is ice! Her will is fire! Princess Crunchy, the unforgiving! Go fight that thing for me!@The Dark Cloud
Finn@Whoa!@The Dark Cloud
Jake@Finn, this ain't workin'. It's just fart grabbin'.@The Dark Cloud
Finn@Yeah, but what else can we do?@The Dark Cloud
Bubblegum@Dudes, I don't know.@The Dark Cloud
Farmer@Look!@The Dark Cloud
Chet@Whoa!@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@I'm gonna poop my pants if Finn kills this guy instead of me!@The Dark Cloud
Peppermint Butler@Wha?!@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@King? Vampire king? You still in here? Hello? Too bad.@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@Oh, boy! Ooh, I am famished!@The Dark Cloud
Farmer@The beast weakens!@The Dark Cloud
Cow@Whoa-ho-ho. Whoa!@The Dark Cloud
Bubblegum@Marceline?@The Dark Cloud
Finn@Marceline?@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@Sorry, what?@The Dark Cloud
Finn@I was just saying we stocked your fridge with lipstick and stuff, so you'll have lots to eat.@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@Aww, thanks, dude.@The Dark Cloud
Jake@Also, we got you crosswords, "sudukus," and connect-the-dots. Just take her easy, buddy.@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@Sure.@The Dark Cloud
Bubblegum@Oh, hey, I was thinking—so, once I usurp Crunchy, I'll have my castle back again, and there's plenty of room there if you don't want to be alone.@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@No, I think I need to ruminate a little—think about being a vampire again.@The Dark Cloud
Finn@Are you, uh... Do you feel bad? I don't want to say, like, "I'm sorry about who you are" or anything if you're feeling okay, but I don't know how bad news all of this is... Right?@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@Nah, I'm cool being a vampire again. Being mortal was good... At the same time, it was terrifying. Now I'm a vampire with fresh mortal memories and—I don't know—more empathy or something... More grown-up. Bonnie, thank you for helping me grow up. Now, I guess we get to hang out together forever.@The Dark Cloud
Finn@Take care!@The Dark Cloud
Bubblegum@See ya, Marcy!@The Dark Cloud
Jake@Later, Vampire Queen!@The Dark Cloud
Vampire King@Your friends seem nice.@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@Um... Are you, like, in my head now, or what?@The Dark Cloud
Vampire King@For now.@The Dark Cloud
Marceline@Well, just don't get in my wa—@The Dark Cloud

Tiny Manticore@Shut... you... This is freaking har—!@Normal Man

Normal Man@Come again?@Normal Man
Tiny Manticore@Nothing. Never mind. Oh, crud. There... he... is!@Normal Man

Normal Man@Whoa!@Normal Man
Tiny Manticore@I... got... you!@Normal Man
Glob@Uh-oh, don't pass out, man. Hey, wake up. Hey.@Normal Man
Tiny Manticore@What?@Normal Man
Normal Man@Pull up! Pull up!@Normal Man
Tiny Manticore@Oh, right. I did it! I have your brother, Magic Man!@Normal Man
Normal Man@It's "Normal Man" now.@Normal Man
Tiny Manticore@Yes... powerless... Normal Man.@Normal Man
Normal Man@Bring him here, Tiny!@Normal Man
Tiny Manticore@No.@Normal Man
Normal Man@Wh—Wh—Huh? What is this?@Normal Man
Tiny Manticore@It's a classic double-cross, bozo!@Normal Man

Tiny Manticore@You messed with me for years! Now it's my turn to mess with you!@Normal Man
