Q:I? There you go again, always blaming me for everything. Well this time I'm not your enemy. I'm not the one that causes the annihilation of mankind. You are.
PICARD:Me?
Q:That's right. You're doing it right now. You did it before and you'll do it again.
PICARD:What sort of meaningless doubletalk is this?
Q:He doesn't understand. I have only myself to blame, I suppose. I believed in you. I thought you had potential. But apparently I was wrong. May whatever god you believe in have mercy on your soul. This court stands adjourned.
PICARD:Commander, assemble the senior staff and go to Red alert. We have a bigger problem than I thought.
RIKER:Red alert!
LAFORGE:I don't believe him. This has to be another one of Q's games. He's probably listening to us right now, getting a big laugh out of watching us jump through his hoops.
PICARD:Normally I would agree with you, but this time I feel that somehow it is different. There was a deadly earnestness about him. I think he's serious. Which means that in some fashion, I am going to be the cause of the destruction of humanity.
CRUSHER:But didn't Q say you already had caused it?
TROI:And that you were causing it now?
DATA:Given the fact that there is an apparent discontinuity between the three time periods the Captain has visited, Q's statement may be accurate, if confusing.
PICARD:So what am I going to do? Lock myself in a room in all three different time periods?
